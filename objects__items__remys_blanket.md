Remy's Blanket
====

A gift from Burt.

Remy loves her blanket. She doesn't exactly guard it, bjt keeps it wherever she feels like "home". Much like a dog and they favorite toys, Remy assumes it will be there when she returns.  She doesn't think about it getting stolen when she isn't around.



Is circular, kinda of stretchy, just like Remy.

It's fabric eventually squeeze out anything inside it. The blanket will always end up "clean" very easy. Lint won't hair "stick", or get stuff inside, and shaking out the blanket will generally result in an almost perfectly clean blanket. when shaken out, It will also become dry no matter wet.

You can really loose things in it's folds.  They'll pop out eventually.

With all the folds, there seemed to be an infinite amount of fabric. It unrolls, and unfolds endlessly in any direction. Like Burt, can become arbitrarily large, although usually grows slowly which it is supposed to.

Similarly, can be rolled up very small.

The blankets fabric has no real world "thick ness", but the edge is thick due to the pair of rolled up ridges running along the blanket

Although there mechanism Has no percievable thickness. Just a front surface and back surface.

Has stretchyness, but always slowly returns back to it's shape.


Overall it behaves very consistenly in default mode.  Buttons, when activated, can affect it's operating and the user's settings/preferences. BBR / Burt obviously have remote control ability as well. (Though BBR and Burt early in the story have no real way of reaching out to do this.)

Is self cleaning an will "reject" anything thrown inside. Anything folding into it will be pushed out gradually.

Buttons can acts as a portal to other locations.
The first button wilbert discovers, acts as a portal to other locations.  Can not just go anywhere though.  Needs a "button", like the one used to bring BBR the first shipment of water.
