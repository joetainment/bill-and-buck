Stories
========
Our cast had many adventures, and so many tales to tell.

<br><br>

With stories like how...
--------------------------
- Bill learned to smile, to laugh and even to love, on his way to true enlightenment.
- Buck traded his naivety for optimism, and learned how to be fun without being foolish.
- Burt discovered friends, and perhaps even "family", while learning all about the interesting creatures of planet Earth.
- Kara found that confidence and humility were better than arrogance and pride, especially for superheroes like her.
- Qoiya discovered the truth and shone a light for all to see.
- ...and Molly exploded.

But we might be getting ahead of ourselves, because if stories have beginnings, we should probably start there. Sure we'll will end up jumping around... but starting, at the start, makes sense to start, so let's start.
