Karen is the secret identity of RoKara, and wears glasses.   ;)

It is 100% totally transparent to the other characters that they are the same character, but sometimes they play along.


She is a pre Quoia reporter, as Karen Ro, and not a very good one.  (Later she quits reporting to focus on her superhero duties.)  She plays like Clark Kent. She does this consciously and even refers to her role model without specifying his name, but it's obvious who she means.

RoKara is like an arrogant Superman, who often causes more harm than good, and then pats herself on the back for it.

She eventually learns humility, and how to be more careful, pay attention, and actually do a decent job. Ultimately she is a great force for good, even though she never completely wises up. Elements of her former arrogant inattentive self do persist, but she tries her best to be better.

Akara, as RoKara, is by far the most powerful of the Roboticcai, at least during the centuries of our story.

She is not particularly intelligent.  She's not exactly stupid, but she's not all that smart either. She can be fooled easily, which is her true weakness, especially combined with her arrogance.







Kara fancies Buck, Buck loves Molly, Molly is obsessed with Bill and Bill secretly has a bit of a thing for Kara.
