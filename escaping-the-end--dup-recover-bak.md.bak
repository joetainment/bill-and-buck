Chapter 11 <br> Escaping The End Of The World
======================
<br>


For once, Wilbert did as he was told. Without hesitation, he ran. Wilbert's legs cycled wildly, propelling him forward as fast as he could go.

The foggy darkness in the air was now clear, and Wilbert could see a path of sparkles leading into the distance. It was the only way to go, so Wilbert followed it, even though it looked as dangerous as everywhere else. Wilbert desperately hoped it would lead him back the way he came.

As Wilbert ran, pieces of the ground around him cracked. With every crack, bits of sparkling metallic crystal shot out in every direction. One after another, fragments of the far off ground would explode. First to his left, and then to his right, wherever he looked, chaos filled his vision. Wilbert couldn't even keep track of it all. It was like being on top of an erupting volcano. Wilbert just kept running as fast as he could.

Briefly, he believed he was headed towards the exit, and for a moment he even believed he might reach it. His beliefs came to a sudden end though, because somewhere deep beneath him there was an especially powerful explosion.

The shockwaves from that blast broke apart everything around Wilbert. The recently solidified ground, the entire area, gave way including the very path that Wilbert ran upon. All of it began to fall into the bottomless pit of emptiness beneath.

Wilbert was falling too, through the void, flailing his arms and grasping at the darkness. It was no use, because there was nothing to grab onto. The only bits around him were chunks of glimmering crystal, all tumbling in free fall. The black space around him had become a sort of shimmering asteroid field.

For a few seconds, Wilbert was lucky enough to avoid crashing into any significant pieces of crystal. His luck didn't last long though. Soon a small chunk came flying towards the back of his head. Wilbert couldn't even see it coming.

The blunt side of it crashed hard into the back of Wilbert's skull. It was not sharp enough to cut him, nor was it heavy enough to break him, but it was hard enough to knock him unconscious.

Just like that, Wilbert was out, his limp body falling aimlessly with the debris, through a vast darkness of space.

All hope was not yet lost however. Even though Wilbert had lost track of her, far off in the distance, Remy was about to take action.

Wilbert may have been unconscious, but Remy was not. Instead Remy was merely disoriented, and confused. Though she was far away from Wilbert's tumbling body, she was still aware of him. The glimmering of the debris provided just enough light for Remy's sensitive vision. She could see Wilbert, just barely in the darkness, far off towards the exit.

Most importantly, Remy still had enough control to direct her motion. This disintegrating world was still her space. She was well accustomed to traveling through the calmer version of it. This would just be a little bit harder.

At her feet, one after another, Remy formed launchpads from which she lept. It was almost the same thing she'd done earlier when she'd created paths for Wilbert. Though her footprints only lasted seconds before shattering, that was all the time she needed to jump away from them.

None of the debris posed any threat to Remy. Instead of being harmed by the waves of destruction, Remy rode through them. She allowed only select forces to propel her.

Remy focused on her targets and quickly picked up speed towards them. Closer to her was her first target. It was her blanket, the sole possession for which she cared. Her gift from Burt.

She reached the blanket quickly and grabbed hold of it. Then she pressed on with determination. Her next goal was Wilbert, and after that, escape.

Building up speed, Remy flung herself towards Wilbert. Upon reaching him she grabbed his hand and gripped hard. Carrying him proved easy enough, because Wilbert was such a small boy for his age, and Remy herself was so very strong for her size.

With Wilbert in hand, Remy felt a wave of relief. She now safely had hold of both her only friend and her only possession. All she still needed to do was reach the exit, and she was already traveling in the right direction.

Flying towards the exit, Remy could tell how little time she had left. The explosions behind her worsened and the walls around the exit barely held together, as if there would soon be no exit left to travel through.

It didn't matter though, because Remy was approaching fast. Before the exit could collapse, she clung tightly to Wilbert and her blanket, then dove through to escape.

Remy's former home, the world she left behind, quickly destroyed itself. Its space gradually shrunk to nothing, and then it simply ceased to exist.

Although Remy's world was annihilated, she'd saved her friend and her blanket. Her heroics had carried them away to safety, through the exit, out of the spaceship, and back to Wilbert's workshop in the barn.
