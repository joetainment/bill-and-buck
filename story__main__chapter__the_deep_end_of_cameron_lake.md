Chapter 15 <br> The Deep End Of Cameron Lake
======================


It was a long ride from the brook to the lake. Wilbert's excitement outweighed his usual frustration and impatience. The blanket was working! In his excitement he assumed the best: That the water would get to BBR, and that it would power her back up again. Soon, Wilbert imagined, he would be building his spaceship. From there on, the opportunities would be endless.

So Wilbert rode eagerly along the sides of the ravines, headed to Cameron Like, with his unworldly cargo.

After a long ride, he reached the final slope of his journey. He was almost at the lake, but was still high up on the mountainside. He only needed to get down its steep trails, across the highway, and then he be at the beach below.

The slope down to the bottom of the mountain was tricky. Wilbert took the gentlest and least muddy combination of trails he could find, and eventually made it to the bottom of the slope. There, the trail was interrupted by the highway. Across that highway he could see the lake!

Traffic was frequent but sparse on the highway, so he simply rode his bike across when there was a long gap between passing cars. Then he continued onto the beach.

The beachy area in front of him jetted out into the lake and formed a peninsula made of sand, rocks, and logs washed up by the large lake's waves. In the middle of the peninsula, up from the shoreline, there were spots of grass, bushes and even a few little trees, before the land sloped down back into sand and then the water. The entire peninsula was essentially a two sided beach.

Wilbert put his bike down near the start of the grassy area between the beaches. Then he gently pulled the blanket away from Remy.

Remy followed, eerily floating a few yards beside Wilbert. She flapped her legs a little as if swimming in the air. Then the flapping turned to steps as she landed, walking on the sand.

Wilbert knelt down on the sand and unfolded the blanket without unrolling the edges. Then he walked over to the lakeshore, where he began to very carefully wade into the lake. He intended to wade in just far enough so that the blanket's far end could sink into the water a few inches.

Facing the center of the lake, he gave a flick and a flap, spreading the blanket out above the water, before carefully allowing it to gently fall down onto the surface. Wilbert then allowed it to sink into the water.

Wilbert reached forward into the water and placed his finger over the button, ready to push it open.

"Here goes," Wilbert said to Remy, looking towards her briefly as she stood on the sandy beach behind him. Wilbert pressed down with his finger, into the groove on the top of the button

Wilbert barely had to touch it. The button reacted as if it knew it was underwater. Immediately, he could feel it open. As the flow of water around his finger picked up, Wilbert pulled his hand back from the button. then firmly held the edge of the blanket with both hands, and waded further into the water.

Slowly at first, the button's opening expanded. Water began flowing, faster and faster into the button as it grew. Soon the water was pouring in.

The button wasn't the only thing growing though. The edges on the blanket were unrolling just as they had at the creek. Wilbert had a tight grasp of the edge where he was holding onto it, but it was becoming difficult to maintain. He tried to stop the blanket's edges from unrolling between his fingers, but his efforts were in vain. He had to keep adjusting his grip with both hands, just to keep holding on.

The unrolling of the edges revealed ever more blanket. Soon the unrolling edges were extending further into the water than Wilbert could see. The blanket was growing so much more than he'd assumed possible.

It was all happening too fast. Wilbert had been so excited, but now he was becoming afraid.

Wilbert realized he was losing control. He didn't want to lose the blanket, but he knew he had to let go. The water around Wilbert's legs was getting turbulent, and the tension of the blanket kept getting stronger. Wilbert knew that if he held on any longer he'd be knocked off his footing. If that happened there was no telling where he'd end up.

Wilbert could imagine being pulled right into the button along with the water itself, into that void of darkness the water was pouring into.

So Wilbert let go, terrified. Then he backed away as fast as he could. He fought against the water and stumbled onto the beach beside Remy.

Together they watched as the blanket disappeared into the depths of the lake.

Immediately, Remy became visibly upset. She frantically moved about the shoreline, looking deeply into the water towards the blanket.

Wilbert couldn't see the blanket anymore, but he could now see the bigger picture forming. Standing on the sand, looking across the water, Wilbert could see strange motion on the wavy surface of the lake. That motion started to cover a larger and larger area. The roughness of the water extending far into the distance.

Then Wilbert began to notice a rumble. He could only hear it faintly at first, but it was enough to scare him into backing away further from the shore. Wilbert could actually feel that rumble, just barely, as a shaking of the earth. He continued to back away and watched.

Horrified, Wilbert began to see a giant whirlpool forming on the lake, he saw that the water's shoreline itself was retreating from the beach.

The magnitude of what was happening seemed unreal. Wilbert started to understand just how serious his situation was.

He began to turn and run away, but in the corner of his eye Remy caught his attention. Unlike Wilbert, she wasn't running away from the water. She was running towards it!

"Remy! No!", Wilbert yelled out at her.

It was too late though. Remy was already gone. She had plunged into the water, searching for her blanket.

Wilbert knew he couldn't possibly go in after her. He couldn't even see her anymore. All he could see was the lake and its rapid destruction.

The lake was quickly becoming a pit. All the water was draining away.

Far off in the distance, a cliffside gave way, turning into a rockslide, and tumbling into the water. All around the steep edges of the lake, bits of land around it started to fall in.

Many of the tallest trees on the lake's edge leaned over before falling into the deepening pit. That same pit which had once been Cameron Lake. The wind howled like a storm as the air rushed to fill in the space left by the water.

That was when fear really took control of Wilbert. That wind put him right back into his storm fearing mindset. He ran as fast as he could, away from the beach, back across the highway and towards the mountainside he'd come from. He was so panicked he didn't even grab his bike, he just ran into the mountain trails away from the lake.

Wilbert tore up that mountain as fast as he could, feeling a need to get to safety. However, as he got farther away from the lake, he started to calm down. He stopped running and tried to catch his breath. As he looked around he was comforted by the fact that, where he was now, the trails in the woods seemed pretty safe. The ground under Wilbert's feet wasn't going anywhere. Much of it was solid granite.

Since he was safe, He was able to calm down. and decide that he still wanted to know what was going on. All he needed was a good view of the lake.

He thought about all the times he'd explored the area and soon he remembered a nearby lookout. That lookout was over a cliff.  It was high enough to have a clear view of the beach he'd just come from. At the same time though, it was far enough away that it would probably be safe.

So, instead of running aimlessly, Wilbert ran towards that lookout.

By the time he reached the lookout, Wilbert was exhausted. He knelt down to catch his breath, leaning on a log near the cliff at the edge of the lookout. He looked around and took in his surroundings. Just as he expected, he had a clear view of the lake below.

That view should have featured a surface of shimmering water, reflecting the clouds above. Such a beautiful sight, however, was no longer anywhere to be found.

Instead, what immediately stood out to Wilbert was the sheer emptiness of it. The huge body of water that had been Cameron lake just minutes ago, had almost completely disappeared. There were puddles and ponds left at the bottom, but for the most part, what Wilbert saw now looked like a giant grimy canyon.

The depth of that canyon was shocking, but it made sense to Wilbert, since the lake had been surrounded by mountains and cliffs, with various beaches interspersed along its shoreline.

The emptying of the lake had caused a lot of damage around that former shoreline. The granite sections were mostly fine, but in other areas, the ground had slid away. Dirt, mud, and rocks had spilled into the lakebed. In some places, the edges of the forest had slipped away with them. Most of what Wilbert could see was just a muddy, rocky mess with various trees and plants mixed up in it.

Wilbert did notice one area of interest. At the far northern edge across from him, at the bottom of the pit, was an even deeper part of the lakebed canyon. It was at such a distance that Wilbert couldn't even see down to the bottom.

Perhaps, Wilbert considered, that deep chasm might have been the place the blanket ended up.

This frustrated Wilbert because if the blanket was down there, he wouldn't be able to see if from this vantage point, he would have to get closer.

Even if he could get close enough to spot it, any attempt at retrieving the blanket wasn't going to be easy.  Climbing down there would be a massive undertaking, one Wilbert was not prepared to make anytime soon.

So, Wilbert hoped the blanket wasn't down there. Instead of dwelling on that worst case scenario, he more widely observed the area from his lookout. Looking east, away from the chasm, Wilbert noticed the farthest parts of the former lake.

Cameron lake had been a long lake, much wider East to West than it had been North to South. Where Wilbert had been on the beach, was near the south west corner of the lake. From that place, a spit of trees had blocked his view to the east, obscuring most of the lake. Now though, from his lookout, Wilbert could see right over those trees.

The east end of the lake was visible in the distance. It was very far away, so it was tough for Wilbert to make out all the details, but he was able to distinguish some of the eastern buildings.

Wilbert's heart sank as he realized...  as he remembered... There was a village at the east end of Cameron lake. The development there was mostly cabins, along with boats and docks. It wasn't a popular place to live, but it was a popular recreation area.

Wilbert couldn't be sure exactly how bad the damage was, since he was looking from so far away. Unfortunately, on that distant lakeshore, what he could decipher looked similar to everywhere else. It looked like a disaster.

While staring, Wilbert also realized he was very lucky that he hadn't brought the blanket straight to the ocean. Just how much of the seawater could the blanket have sucked away? Wilbert was relieved he hadn't had to find out. There was no telling what level of destruction it could have caused. The lake was big enough, but the ocean? That could have been apocalyptic, the end of human civilization.

Even the comparatively smaller devastation all around the lake was tragic.  Thinking about it would only have made Wilbert feel guilty, but instead, he was able to distract himself, because he remembered there was a more immediate concern.

Remy was probably still down there somewhere.

"Remy..." Wilbert spoke softly and sadly in despair.

Wilbert started to feel a bit better though,  because the more he thought about it, the more convinced he became that Remy was probably fine.

Sure, she could have been pulled through the buttton, into the void of the blanket, but Wilbert was pretty confident that she wouldn't have let that happen.

If Remy could stay unaffected by anything else, surely she could have moved through the water without it washing her away.

Wilbert looked down at the beach where he had first put down the blanket. It was nearby, just below and to the west of the lookout.

"Where are you Remy?"  Wilbert mumbled to himself, hoping Remy would make her way back.

Wilbert waited a long time, struggling to stay awake. He was exhausted. All the day's traveling had become so much for him. He nodded in and out of sleep for hours.

As Wilbert napped, the sky became darker and the clouds thickened, gradually looking much more like the storm clouds from the day before. Then it started to rain, just a sprinkle at first, but it would only get worse.

Awakened and alerted by the rain, Wilbert looked to the east again. Now that it was evening, it was darker out, and he noticed he could see lights in the distance.  He couldn't hear any siren sounds at such a distance, but the flashing lights of emergency vehicles were obvious.

After watching those lights for a while,  Wilbert looked back towards the beach.

He was elated by what he saw!  Remy had returned!  She was on the beach, and she'd brought with her the blanket, which was now back to its regular size.

Remy's mouth held it at first,  dragging it behind her as she walked. Eventually she let it down, and sat upon it.  Only a few feet from where Wilbert had left his bike. It was clear that Remy had intentionally returned to this same place.

"Remy!" Wilbert yelled out as loud as he could, trying to get her attention.

Down on the beach, Remy noticed his call.

She looked up, spotting Wilbert on the ledge.

Then she stared right at Wilbert for a couple of seconds, obviously able to see him, before turning away, lying back on the blanket.

Wilbert yelled several more times, but he couldn't get Remy to look back, so Wilbert decided he'd have to go down to the water.

Wilbert descended from the lookout, crossed the highway to the beach, and hurriedly walked towards Remy.

When he reached her though, he was clearly unwelcomed. Remy was very obviously annoyed. Wilbert kept trying to pet her, but whenever he did, she would immediately withdraw, eventually stepping right off the blanket and walking a few feet away as she dragged it along with her.

In her eyes, Wilbert was to be scorned, because Wilbert had lost her blanket.

Still... thought Wilbert, she had returned to the beach... so she couldn't have been too angry.

"Don't be mad Remy," Wilbert explained to her, "I didn't mean to lose your blanket."

Remy couldn't understand, but she didn't much care to hear from Wilbert anyway. Her display of annoyance was completely intentional.

For a good few minutes, Wilbert stayed back, a few feet from Remy, until she finally stood up again and walked back to face Wilbert.

Remy still seemed annoyed, but she obviously wasn't too upset. She just stared at Wilbert.   Eventually she started to shrug and looked side to side, before nodding her head upwards and pointing her nose at the mountain they'd originally come from.

Wilbert got the hint.  "Yeah, okay, we can go now," he replied.

Wilbert picked up the blanket, and walked back to his bike. He put the blanket back in the bike's basket, and then watched as Remy jumped in too.

"Let's go home, Remy."

Wilbert shook his head, got on his bike, and started to peddle. It was going to be a slow grind after a long day, and Wilbert still felt very guilty.

He sighed as he rolled away from the beach.

"I just want to go home."
