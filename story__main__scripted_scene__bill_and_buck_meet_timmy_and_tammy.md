
Bill and Buck Mett Timmy and Tammy
======================================


Bill

Where did you get that?

=
Timmy

From myself?

I fabbed it.


=
Bill

You "fabbed" it?


-

Timmy:


Yeah like as in "fabricated", ummm...  like...  almost like with a printer, but one that makes real things,  3D things.  I guess it's like a "3D" printer.

I'm not very good at it yet, but I'm getting better at it. I think the science guys can make more  Complicated stuff than I can.


-

Bill:

Okay okay okay! But where did you get the idea? Why did you even make that thing?


-

 Timmy

Cuz he's funny?


-

Bill

Who??? Who's funny?


-

Timmy

You know... that guy, that thing, the one who looks like this

You know, he hops around and he does stupid stuff.

You must have seen him.

You can't not see him, he's everywhere, he just shows up everywhere


-

Tammy

But kind of random, like you never know when



-

Bill

Oh we've seen them all right. It can be pretty annoying he follows us to


Do you know what he is?


-

Timmy

I don't know man. He looks kind of like a frog or something. He just follows us around sometimes, it's messed up.


-

Tammy

 and then there's that wacky raccoon

He follows her around 2


-

Timmy

What's even crazier is he follows us both at the same time. Even when we both go to totally separate places. like, we can both take pictures of him at the same time and completely different places


-

Bill

Oh yeah he does that all the time he's been following us around for years.


-

Tammy

Sometimes he walks off though!


-

Bill

Haha, you ever follow him?


-

Timmy

Nah, we can't. he walks off into the Wasteland

(Timmy points East)



-

Bill

So why don't you follow him there?


-

Timmy

We can't man, it's bad you can't go into the Wasteland. Some people try, but they always come back.


-

Bill

Why is that?


-

Timmy

They get sick. Just gets worse the farther they go. So yeah, they come back.
At least they usually get better though.
I heard a couple people even tred to go out there again, but they never got very far, they just keep coming back.


-

Bill

That is incredibly strange.


-

Tammy

I'm actually going to try. I'm going to go. I'm pretty tough.


-

Timmy

Not this again

-

Tammy

I think I can make it, even if I can't I bet I can make it further than anyone else


-

Bill

Why do you think you would make it?


-

Tammy

I don't get sick much, and stuff it hurts other people hardly ever hurts me


-

Timmy

Hang on, hang on. It's not like you're Invincible or something, you just don't feel pain not like normal people. you can still get hurt. You can get sick.


-

Tammy

Yeah, but I hardly ever do. I'm super healthy.


-

Timmy

Yeah, that's mostly true. You're probably the healthiest person I've ever met really.



-

Tammy

And that's why I can do it


-

Timmy

Wait man, as far as I can tell, you're some kind of robot. maybe like that frog thing?

I bet you could go out there. I bet you could follow him.


-

Bill

Oh yeah, trust me, I definitely will.

If Burt's out there, then yeah, for sure.

-

Timmy

Burt?


-

Bill

Yeah, Burt, that's his name, the little robot frog.


-

Timmy

Haha, that's hilarious, the sound he makes. I mean, I guess it kind of sounds like "Burt"


-

Bill
Yeah, that's why we call him that.

"I see people over there."

"If we drive this thing in there, people are going to freak out. ...Jake how about you stay here. Just chill. We'll walk over there... come on Buck."
