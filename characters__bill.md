Bill was the first of the Roboccai.

He is their defacto leader and ultimately the  wisest among them, until he eventually leaves the universe, at which point he passes on his leadership role to Quoia. (This is well after the events and climax of the main story.)

When at his best, especially later in life, Bill represents the author's (Joe's) best qualities.

Bill is more similar to Wilbert than he may like to admit. He was was somewhat originally based on Wilbert


He is highly intelligent, but not nearly as intelligent as Wilbert. However, also much less stupid than Wilbert.  Not so ADHD, not so absent minded (though maybe a little). Not so obsessive and arrogant as Wilbert.

He tries to tinker and do robotics on them, but has a much harder time than Wilbert.  His stuff is much more dependable though, and it's better thought out, even if not as "advanced".  He never learns to understands much of Wilbert's technology, but accepts that it's okay.

Early on he is an absolute extreme pessimist.  A stick in the mud.  His attitude is in fact what drives Wilbert to make Buck.

Also early in life, was often locked in  a  room, and had nothing but a VCR and some tapes, so he watched home movies of Wilbert and his family.

His beanie spins counterclockwise because heâ€™s a rebel and he wants people to know it.

Bill's story arc has him go from being totally pessimistic and bitter to being a cautious optimist. He goes from anger to peace and enlightenment.  By the very end he is somewhat like Yoda in Star Wars.

Like Yoda, Bill chooses to "leave".  (Which *can* be interpreted as his death.)

Ultimately Bill works together with a redemption seeking Wilbert in saving the universe, quite some time before Bill goes away.


"Keeping it real"
After their second rebuild, (the one Wilbert designed and Jake initiated)
Bill only does minor work on the Robotticai.
Doesn't change their bodies that much, even though he could, decides not to.
Only near the very end just before he leaves,
does he give "Captain Buck" a very significant upgrade.
