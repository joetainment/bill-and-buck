Intermission - Rivers and Roses
=====================

"Rivers and Roses" read the huge sign at the side of the highway, years ago. It was on the #4 Alberni Highway, and the sign was located between the north end of Qualicum Beach and the east end of Cameron Lake.

The sign described "The very best food! Made with farm fresh and natural ingredients!" It then invited everyone to the farm reading, "Customers welcome. Only a minute off the highway!"

The destination was a place named after Wilbert's Aunt Rose, who owned the farm, and her close friend River, who was often inaccurately called Wilbert's uncle.

Rivers and Roses had developed into an enterprise that became so much more than an ordinary farm. Rose had establised a popular brand of luxury desserts, and produced them at Rivers and Roses. To keep production up with demand, many addional buildings had been added over the years. Rose and her workers made that farm an industry unto itself.

All of that suddenly ended though, because Rose died in early 1995, several months before Wilbert discovered Burt.

After Rose died, it quickly became apparent that she hadn't prepared the farm for such an eventuality. She simply left everything to Wilbert and his parents.

Wilbert's parents moved into the farmhouse almost immediately, but they put absolutely no effort into running the farm. Instead, they rapidly began drawing money from Roses considerable accounts.

The farm itself (a private company) ceased operations, and Wilbert parents, in their own apathy, were perfectly okay with just letting most of it sit around deteriorating. The only real work they'd done was hiring someone to handle their legal obligations and tie up any loose ends. That person handled bills, removed the livestock and produce, and  even took care of firing the employees.

Rivers and Roses became a ghost town, and Wilbert himself became its only explorer. All the while, his parents stayed in the house, spending his aunt's money as they fed their addictions incessantly.

The place couldn't really be called "Rivers and Roses" anymore. Even calling it a farm had become a real stretch, since there was no longer any farming being done. Once Wilbert and his parent's moved in, their family name became a more truthful descriptor. By then, it only made sense to call the place, "The Watterson's".

"Rivers and Roses" read the huge sign at the side of highway, but most of it was covered up now, preventing visitors from wasting their time on a place that no longer existed.
