Chapter 14 <br> Bodies of Water
======================


The wind was strong in Wilbert's face as he cycled down the farm roads. "Rivers and Roses" as the farm was named, was massive. Even just getting off of the property took Wilbert quite a while. He was forced to navigate around or through a lot of puddles and mud as he went. Though he avoided the worst of it, he still ended up going through more mud than he would have liked, and before long his rain gear was splattered all over.

For the most part, he just ignored it. He was dressed for the messy conditions. Even if he hadn't been, he would have continued on. It would have taken a lot more than mud to stop Wilbert.

He went past the edges of the crop fields, then rode through a forested section, until he was at the edge of an old fence surrounded a beautiful meadow of tall grass and boulders. Other days he rode by, he'd have stopped at the meadow to play on those boulders. That morning though, he carried on past them and soon they were far behind.

Finally, after cycling a few hundred yards deeper into the forest, he reached a gate in a tall fence. That gate marked the edge of the Watterson's land.

There, deep amongst the tall trees, he parked his bike and walked towards the gate.  Wilbert was actually too short to reach the latch, so he hopped onto a leaning fallen log that was nearby, and walked upwards towards the top of the fence.

As he reached the top, he had an incredible view of the surrounding forest. He had seen it all before, but Wilbert always felt something was magical about it.

What made the place so special was that because it had been privately owned for so long, the property still had old growth trees on it, the kind rarely preserved anywhere else.

Wilbert marveled at those gigantic douglas-fir trees. Many of their trunks were wider than a typical car. They towered so high that it was difficult to even see all the way to their tops. Shadows of the trees and their branches covered most of the area below, with only small patches of sunlight ever getting through. In those shadows, thick underbrush, ferns, and moss thrived all over the forest floor.

Wilbert reached the gate, hung over the edge, and kicked the latch open with his foot. Then, he very carefully climbed down a little farther, pushed off and let go of the fence, dropping a few feet to the ground.

The hassle of opening the gate made Wilbert consider that it might have been nice to be taller, but he decided it probably wouldn't. Although being short was a bit of a drag for Wilbert at times, in many ways it was advantageous, since he could sneak into tight spaces, and make himself difficult to find. It had enabled him to get into a lot of mischief over the years.

In any case, for the time being, he remained very short, so he just had to make the best of it. Climbing up fences to open gates was just one of the many ways he'd adapted. Besides, he thought, climbing was actually a lot of fun.

With the gate open, Wilbert pushed the bike through. Then he found a large rock and used it to wedge the gate open for the return trip.

Then he got on the bike and picked up speed again, following the trail through the forest, and leaving the Watterson land behind.

Past the property line, the new forest looked substantially different. The trees were still tall, but not nearly as wide, and the terrain was becoming rockier and more mountainous.

Wilbert wound along a trail on the side of a smaller moutain, riding up the path's gentle slope. Down that mountain side was a valley. At its bottom was a creek or perhaps even a small river. (One of several in the local area.)

That was a lot more water than Wilbert wanted at the moment though.  So much water that the blanket would probably be swept away and lost. So, Wilbert continued on, remembering the wide, slow, and shallow water way he was headed for.

Within a few minutes of westward travel, Wilbert reached a plateau that leveled off and became a less forested area beside the mountain.

He peddled hard, excited that he was so close to his destination, and after about 50 yards, he squeezed the brakes and came to a stop, within a few feet of the wide brook, his intended test site.

Wilbert got off of his bike, and moved his backpack to the driest spot he could find, some smooth wet rocks nearby.

He then walked back to his bike, and reached into the basket, pulling at the blanket while gently nudging at Remy. Remy was cooperative enough. Like a ghost, she slid through the wires of the basket. Then, mostly ignoring the force of gravity, she gently drifted to the ground before finding a nice smooth rock to sit on.

With Remy out of the way, Wilbert pulled the blanket from the basket, shook it out, and spread it over some rock so that the side with the buttons faced him.

Wilbert knew he needed to open up the button so that water could flow through it, towards wherever BBR wanted it to go. So, he considered various ways of opening it. The easiest way became obvious.

He already knew the button opened easily when exposed to water. There were plenty of puddles nearby, so Wilbert scooped up some water into the palm of his hand, and splashed it onto the button, then he pryed at it with his fingernails, and voila!  The button opened up, becoming a ring. Hissing air and  droplets were sucked into the button's opening, and with each drop of water the ring got a little wider, and the hissing a little quieter. Before long, the air pressure seemed to even out.

After a few more scoops of water, and a bit of pulling on the ring, Wilbert was able to stretch the opening out to the width of his head, which Wilbert thought would suffice.

Wilbert knew he didn't have much time before it closed. Watching as the button slowly shrunk, Wilbert hurriedly unrolled the blanket's circular edges, until he exposed an area about 6 feet wide, much larger than Wilbert himself in fact.

Then Wilbert turned the blanket over, so that the blanket's buttons were on the side facing away from him.

Rushing before the button closed completely, Wilbert dragged the blanket, into the shallow water of the brook. He gave it a flick, flapping it out and splaying it as far as he could, then gently lowered his end of the blanket into the water.

The button almost closed, but Wilbert was fast enough, and soon, the button came into contact with the water, which was now rolling over the edge of the blanket.

Immediately, the button started to grow again. It grew surprisingly quickly, and was almost as wide as the brook before Wilbert could have counted to ten.

A steady supply of water now rolled over the blanket's surface. Into the button's hole, now a wide ring, the water flowed before falling into the endless void beyond the ring.

As a waterfall, it looked like a flowing curtain reflecting the forest outside of the void. Deeper inside the void there was nothing else to reflect or refract. Utimately, the waterfall descended so far into the darkness that its bottom could not be seen.

The area downstream from the open button became shallower and slowed to a trickle, as almost its entire water supply was cut off.

There wasn't much pull or tension that he could feel, so Wilbert let go of the blanket with one of his hands, reached for a couple nearby rocks and put them on his end of the blanket to weigh it down.

It seemed stable enough, so he released his other hand and stood by, making sure it would stay put.

It worked!  Wilbert had created a new stable waterfall.  Wilbert was amused to think that as the water fell further and further, it might soon become the tallest waterfall ever known. He simply had no idea how far it would be falling through that darkness.

Looking over the edge of the button made Wilbert pretty nervous. What if he tripped and lost his footing? The thought of falling into the void was terrifying.

Wilbert decided not to think about it too much, and simply backed away, towards the rocks from which Remy was watching. Then he sat down beside her, quite pleased with himself.

Wilbert reached into his bag and fixed himself a snack, then he ate as he watched the new waterfall... and waited.

What was he waiting for? Wilbert didn't know. After a few minutes he started to wonder if there was ever any way to know how much water was enough.

Shouldn't there be some sort of sign?  He thought...  Some way of knowing when the tank was full? Was there even a tank at all?  Wilbert hadn't the faintest idea of where that water was going. All Wilbert was confident of was that getting it into the blanket was the surest way to get it back to BBR. Either the blanket was a gateway to the inside of his spaceship, or the blanket was like a tank into which water would be stored so he could bring it back to her.

Would the button close once it had enough water? Wilbert didn't bother to find out.

After about 20 minutes, Wilbert decided that he was through being patient. This had been a successful test, but he didn't feel like waiting around all day for something to happen. Since he hadn't gotten any kind of reaction from the blanket, he would assume this brook wasn't enough water, and find a larger source.

Wilbert walked over to the blanket, picked it up and shook it out.

Within moments it seemed to be completely dry, and clean. The open ring of the button began shrinking back down, closing, and ending up just as it had been before, as a dimpled button.

Wilbert gathered everything up and motioned at Remy who by then was relaxed and reluctant to move.

"C'mon Remy..." he said. ..."We can go now."

Remy didn't budge.

After a bit of frustration, Wilbert remembered what BBR had told him about Remy being maddenly indifferent at times.

"Okay... I'm leaving then," he said, even though he had no intention of leaving her behind.

He held up a part of the blanket, waved it about enough to be obvious, then put it back into the basket.  At a medium pace he began walking the bike away from her.

Seeing the blanket getting farther away from her  was enough to motivate Remy. She walked up into the bike's tires, and jumped upwards, right through the bottom of the basket, back out the top, before falling back down and landing snugly into the blanket.

Wilbert got on the bile, got going, and headed north.  He considered going to the small river at the bottom of the valley, but he knew the current was too strong. He considered Cameron River as well, but that current was even stronger.

No... the one place he could think of without a current, and more water than he thought he could possibly need, was a lake. It was the deepest, largest lake in the area, Cameron Lake.

It was a few hours ride, but Wilbert could do it. He'd done it before, although he'd also crashed a few times on the steep mountain paths just before the lake.

Wilbert decided he'd just have to be more careful this time.

Remy could hear him as he thought out loud. "Cameron Lake!", he said... 'No mistakes!".
