Remy The Raccoon
======================

Remy is not a raccoon, but presents similarly to one when she's in our world.

She is Burt's pet, and arrived with Burt, she was a passenger onboard when he crashed.

Remy is ultra laid back, and "chill". Remy can seem extraordinarily lazy quite often.

Remy demonstrates a high degree of indifference most of the time. She is much more like a cat than a dog. She can't be trained or bossed around. As far as the other characters can tell, she doesn't really need anything and can't be harmed in any way.

Remy is invisible at times, and can become immaterial, and even ghostly. Objects can pass right through her.

Remy doesn't do much, but she does often point things out, sometimes going out of her way to draw attention to things.  She guides other characters at times.

Eventually Remy does come to have a mild fondness for those around her.  It's almost as though she considers the humans and robii to be her pets.  She does like some attention, and enjoys being petted etc, like a cat.

She has almost no story arc.  Her character stays about the same from story start to end.

Generally speaking, at a glance, Remy just seems cute and adorable.

It is Remy who leads Jake to find the Landyaught and the pieces of Bill and Buck. It is she and her ghosting-field that allows him to travel the wasteland. (She normalizes spacetime so it doesn't interfere with his brain and make him sick like it normally would.)
