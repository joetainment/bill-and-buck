Chapter 5 - In Spite Of Fear
======================
<br>

The evening had darkened to a pitch black night. The weather had worsened, and the storm was now in full effect. Carried by a warm and raging wind, a thick veil of chaotic clouds cloaked the stars and obscured the night's new moon. Lightning flashed, and was followed almost instantaneously by crashing thunder.

Sitting beneath the storm was Wilbert's workshop in the barn. Thousands of tiny taps of raindrops pattered down against its windows. The howling winds shook the old wooden building, and although it was probably the sturdiest structure on the farm, Wilbert was irrationally fearful, worrying it might fall to pieces at any moment. In a way, his fear was understandable… Wilbert had not had a pleasant history with storms.

He was also fearful because the barn was now very dark inside. The storm had knocked the power out, and although the barn had a gas powered generator, Wilbert hadn't actually worked up the courage to get it going yet.

In fact, Wilbert hadn't really worked up the courage to do anything for the last hour or so. He was now sitting nearly motionless. His only real movement was shaking and shifting uncomfortably in his hiding place.

Yes, Wilbert was hiding, or more precisely, he was cowering, under a corner of his desk. A sort of "cave" was formed by the desk's thick backing panels, and this made the space underneath feel like a comforting shelter to Wilbert.

There in his cave, Wilbert gripped a flashlight tightly in his hands. When the power had gone out, all the lights in the barn had suddenly gone dark, so the flashlight was now the only reason Wilbert could see anything at all.  The only other source of light was the occasional flashes of lightning outside, and that lightning scared Wilbert even more than the darkness.

Wilbert knew that if he wanted more light, he'd have to fuel the generator and get it set up, but he just wasn't ready to do that yet. He lacked the courage to leave his hiding place. So instead, Wilbert just sat in waiting, hoping for the storm to settle down.

As he sat, he stared ahead where he could see the spaceship in the middle of the barn. Illuminated by his flashlight, it sat in a pool of light surrounded by darkness. The spaceship was on the floor, just like Wilbert was, but unlike Wilbert, it wasn't really on the floor. Instead, it was just above the floor, hovering eerily. Since the earlier event, the ship had stayed parked in its place, and it seemed to have done nothing else.

Wilbert stared at the ship, and as he did so, it seemed to stare back at him, grinning. The shape of its bow was like a mocking smile. To Wilbert, it felt as though his ship was toying with him, getting his hopes up and then snatching them away.

Hours ago, the spaceship had seemed to open up. Momentarily, Wilbert had believed he'd found a way inside, but instead, he'd quickly discovered that he was still completely locked out.

As a result, there was real bitterness in Wilbert's heart, but that bitterness also motivated his attention. Even as he was cowering and afraid, he was also determined. If the ship was going to do anything, Wilbert wanted to be watching, because he wanted to see it happen.

In his determination, even while Wilbert hid under his desk, he kept his eyes fixed intently on his spaceship. Wilbert stared so heavily at the spaceship that he rarely blinked, and before long his eyes began to sting. Wilbert lifted his eyeglasses, closed his eyelids, and rubbed them with his hands.

Just then, suddenly, Wilbert saw it. Through his squinting eyelids, he could see a flash of motion, and quickly he reacted. Opening his eyes wide, he peered towards the opening of the spaceship.

Something seemed to be happening, but Wilbert couldn't say exactly what. It all appeared very blurry, and the fact that Wilbert wasn't looking through his glasses didn't help. He quickly scrambled to put his glasses back in front of his eyes. As soon as he had them back in place, he immediately refocused on the ship.

For a moment, just a fraction of a second, he saw something move again, but before he had time to examine it, he lost track.

Intrigued, Wilbert kept staring at the ship. He saw nothing more of interest, so he considered whatever had just happened.

Whatever Wilbert had seen, it was blurry. Wilbert thought that it could even be described as being wavy. It was almost like boiling water, and a bit like steam from the spout of a kettle. It had seemed to come from the ship's blackened window.

Wilbert scanned over the ship intently, looking for signs of anything more, but there was nothing.

The fear that Wilbert was feeling started to be displaced by his curiosity, and that curiosity gave Wilbert a tiny bit of courage.

"This might be my only chance at this…"  he muttered to himself under his breath.

Despite a certain amount of terror, Wilbert inched forward. He hesitated, took a deep breath, and then finally came out from under the desk and carefully stood up.

With the walls and the windows still rattling, Wilbert nervously stood for a moment. Then, he started to move again, and slowly approached the spaceship. As he approached, he stopped every few steps to make sure everything was still okay, swinging his flashlight up, down, and side to side, checking the roof and the windows.

Though the winds raged outside, inside the barn everything seemed fine. At least, for now, nothing seemed broken. The wailing wind was still scary, the rattling of the windows was still unnerving, and the darkness made all of it even worse. Regardless, in spite of his fears, Wilbert kept up his courage and continued to proceed forward, until he finally reached the ship in the center of the barn. Once up close, he scanned over the ship with his flashlight, and the beam of light shimmered across the ship's green hull.
 
Wilbert noticed that in this darkness, the ship seemed to have qualities of glowing and iridescence. Wherever he shined the light, it kept twinkling with tiny rainbows, which persisted even for a few moments after he moved the light away. The effect was very dim, and he hadn't noticed it during the daylight. Now though, in such extreme darkness, the brief twinkling glow was obvious.
 
Remembering which part of the ship he was really interested in, Wilbert shined his flashlight at the "window", where the motion had seemed to have come from.  As his flashlight's beam reached the window, he was astonished by the fact that it was still one hundred percent, completely pitch black. Even with his light up close, shining right at the window, it showed no sparkles, no reflections, and nothing at all except total darkness. Wilbert couldn't even tell if he was looking through a window into a dark room, or if he was looking at some kind of perfectly black panel. Of everything Wilbert had seen, this window was proving to be the strangest thing yet.
 
Wilbert reached out and touched the window, and like before, what he felt was something that seemed totally solid, but completely smooth. So smooth that it was, as far as he could tell, perfectly frictionless. It was by far the most slippery surface he'd ever touched, and he briefly considered how it would have made for an ideal slide at a playground.
 
The pressure from Wilbert's hand caused the ship to drift slightly, and he pulled his hand back from the window. As the drift slowed to a halt, Wilbert looked down towards the bottom of the ship where it hovered just slightly above the floor. He tried to spot anything different but, as hard as he looked, everything seemed just the same as before.
 
Wilbert was gradually becoming more frustrated, and he was close to losing his patience, but before his frustration built up too much, Wilbert was shocked by a sudden crash.
 
Clang! ... clink, clink, clinkity, clink…
 
Wilbert spun around with his flashlight and quickly discovered an old coffee can, rolling along the floor before coming to a stop. The can was tipped over, and little nuts, bolts, and washers now surrounded it, all spilling out from its insides. The can had clearly fallen off the edge of the workbench by his desk.
 
For a moment, Wilbert thought that maybe the wind had knocked over the can, but for the most part, the barn was quite intact, and it really wasn't windy inside. Even if there had been some kind of gust of wind, inside the barn, it seemed very unlikely that it could have knocked over a can full of heavy nuts and bolts.
 
No… something else had knocked over that can.
 
Wilbert wondered if it had something to do with the spaceship, but before jumping to conclusions, he also considered whether or not it could have been an animal.
 
There were many little critters in the area and it wasn't that strange to find any of them in his barn. However, the animals he'd seen in his barn were almost never anything larger than a mouse or a squirrel. Wilbert wasn't even sure how the mice were getting in, but he knew for sure that the door kept the larger animals safely outside. He'd never found a bear, a dear, or even a raccoon, actually hiding inside his barn. As far as Wilbert could remember, the largest animal he'd ever found in his barn was his cat.
 
Wilbert's cat was pretty annoying. It knocked things over all the time. Still, even then, would his cat have bothered to knock over the coffee can? Nuts and bolts are heavy, and it would have been a lot of work for the cat to push a can full of them off the workbench. There were no treats or food in that can either, only small pieces of metal, nothing that would have been of much interest to a cat. It seemed very unlikely that his cat, or any other animal, had knocked the can over.
 
So, an idea from the back of Wilbert's mind started to come into the foreground. It was definitely scary, but it was incredibly exciting at the same time. He had been almost repressing it up to that point, because he was being careful not to get his hopes up. However, as Wilbert looked at the coffee can, and then back at the spaceship, Wilbert suspected something he would soon confirm.
 
The motion he'd seen had been something emerging from the ship, and Wilbert knew it... He just knew it!  Whatever had come out of that ship was now moving about Wilbert's barn. Moreso, if the blurry motion had been something coming out of the spaceship, then maybe even, whatever emerged had really been someone. The truth was becoming more and more clear to Wilbert.
 
As he heard another sudden crash from the north side of the barn, Wilbert spun around with his flashlight, and pointed to where he would soon confirm his suspicions.
 
Wilbert had a visitor.
