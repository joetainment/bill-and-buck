Chapter 10 - Mutual Agreement
======================
<br>


Remy Raccoon rested drowsily on her bedding, surrounded by the mostly empty void that was her home.

In general, Remy had a real streak of laziness in her personality. She liked to rest a lot. That day in particular though, her rest was well deservered. She'd had a lot of excitement, venturing from her home, finding Wilbert and bringing him back to join her. It had all made her feel rather stressed out.

Now though, Remy felt at ease, satisfied, and most importantly, so much less lonely than before, because now she had a guest.

Remy could see that her guest, Wilbert, had been introduced to her caretaker, BBR. Although Remy didn't understand their discussion, it was clear that Wilbert and BBR were communicating at least. So Remy stayed in her bed, half asleep, listening to their voices and only occasionally opening her eyes to watch them.

Remy didn't understand it, but Wilbert had made a request, an incredible, impossible, request. Wilbert had asked to understand "everything". BBR understood the request and instantly recognized its impossibility.

So, BBR answered Wilbert's question very directly, "I cannot grant your request, for it is impossible for any being to understand everything. Not even Burt himself could have such an understanding."

Wilbert shock his head and stared at his feet for a moment. He struggled to come up with a response at first, but soon decided that BBR was simply being too literal about the meaning of the word "everything". He wanted to cut through such nonsense technicalites.

So, Wilbert responded, "Fine... maybe not *everything*, but as much as possible. At least make me understand your technology."

BBR replied immediately, "Even that, I may not be able to provide."

Wilbert was frustrated hearing this, and quickly challanged, "Why not?"

BBR explained, "For many reasons. For one, learning so much would take longer than the span of your own life. Perhaps more importantly though, even given unlimited time, your primitive brain could not process such information."

BBR's response was both insulting and disappointing to Wilbert, but he was undeterred, and continued to press, "I don't care if it takes forever. Find a way.  If I can't handle it, make me able to handle it, help me!"

Really, Wilbert was just snapping back at this point. He was not even fully considering the meaning of his own words, especially the last few, which would set in motion much more than Wilbert had ever considered.

For the time being however, BBR stayed silent and simply observed Wilbert. This small human in front of her made facial expressions that implied an exhuastion of patience. BBR knew that her hopes for any agreement were close to being shattered. In order to find a solution, she considered various interpretations of Wilbert's request. Then she imagined possible forms of its fulfillment.

After careful observation and consideration, BBR decided that there were in fact feasable solutions. Even if Wilbert could never truly understand the workings of a living spaceship like Burt, Wilbert could certainly learn enough to build creations that would, at least to Wilbert, be very impressive.

"There are options to approximate your request," conceeded BBR, "You could be taught to understand some of the simplest technology, though you would need some modification in order to understand much more. Thus, it would be easiest if you would start with the simplest concepts and then progress from there."

"Okay," Wilbert said, as he began to grin,  "Now we're talkin!"

BBR reminded Wilbert of her current limitations, "In my weakened state, am not yet capable of helping you. Before we begin your education, I will need your assistance."

Wilbert was pleased that he'd gotten some kind of positive response, but was very worried about helping BBR before gaining anything himself. How could he be sure she would actually help him? Skeptically, Wilbert once again challanged BBR, "Even before you do anything for me? Why should I do everything first?"

BBR responded forcefully, "Because there is no other way. I am both unable, and unwilling, to assist you in my present state. If you will not trust enough to assist me, then there is little we can do for each other."

There was a long silence.  Wilbert didn't like this turn of events. It seemed to him that the balance of power was tilting in the wrong direction. This reminded him of his many frustrating experiences with his parents and other authorities. Being in charge and in control was especially important to Wilbert, so he was worried.

Wilbert had no other options though, and he knew it. He would need to compromise. Wilbert decided that he had to find a way to be just flexible enough.

"Okay, well, maybe I *can* help you first, just a little bit," Wilbert offered, "But I'll expect some help back soon. You better hold up your end of the bargain."

"I will honor our agreement." BBR reassured Wilbert and explained, "You will not need to wait long, because I require only a single task performed in order to stabalize my condition, which will enable your education."

"Meaning if I do this one thing for you, you can start to teach me?" asked Wilbert.

"Exactly," replied BBR.


There was another pause as Wilbert considered what BBR was saying. It sounded reasonable to Wilbert. Better than reasonable in fact, assuming she could be trusted.

"Okay!" said Wilbert.

BBR and Wilbert had come to an initial agreement, and luckily for Wilbert, BBR planned to honor her agreements. She was designed to do so, and Burt would expect no less of her.

Wilbert became quite excited and was eager to get started.        
        
"So what am I supposed to do?" Wilbert asked, "You can explain that to me at least, right?"

It seemed indeed that it was the right time to explain her plans, so BBR began by assigning to Wilbert his first task.

"In service of my repairs, your first task will be very simple. You will make deliveries to me."

Wilbert cut BBR off pretty quickly. His impatience was evident again. "How could I do that?" asked Wilbert, "What could I possiobly have that you would need?"

BBR took notice of how prone Wilbert was to interupting. Nevertheless, BBR patiently continued.

"Allow me to explain... It is *energy* that I require to implement my repairs," said BBR, "Of the requirement for energy, even I am not exempt."

Wilbert started to understand, and asked, "So what do you want then? Fuel? Batteries?"

BBR responsed, "No. You use such unnecessary primitive stores of energy. I have no use of such limited storage. Instead, I will directly convert matter to energy."

Wilbert immediately understood, because he knew the most famous of all the Earth's equations, "E=mc^2". Wilbert knew that even just a little bit of matter was actually a huge amount of energy.

BBR went on, "The easiest source for energy will be what you call 'hydrogen'.  It is the most basic and common form of matter in your universe. It is also the simplest to manipulate. Even in my failing state I will be able to convert hydrogen to energy..."

Wilbert was doubtful. "I don't have any hydrogen," Wilbert started to say, but even before he finished his sentence he knew he was wrong, because he knew that water contained hydrogen. Water was "H2O", and the "H" in "H2O" meant hydrogen.

This also made Wilbert somewhat afraid for a moment, because he realized his own body was largely made up of water, something BBR would consider to be fuel.  The idea of BBR being a flesh eating monster suddenly seemed more plausible. Luckily, at least for now though, BBR seemed to be peaceful enough. Wilbert decided that if BBR had intended to eat him, she already would have done so. This meant he was probably safe.

BBR herself went on to mention what Wilbert already knew.

"Water will be sufficient for my needs," she said, "Every molecule of water has two hydrogen atoms. Its chemincal bonds pose no challange to me."

Quickly, Wilbert's confidence was growing.  Water was something Wilbert could deliver.

"Oh wow, yeah, we've got tons of water. Around my place there's *too* much of it. Outside, it's literally falling out of the sky right now."

BBR explained that water had been an important aspect of her plan from the start, "Yes. Quickly after our crash into your spacetime, even through Burt's malfunctioning senses, I was able to observe water on this planet. The likelyhood of finding water was part of my reason for initially landing on your blue planet."

This actually made a lot of sense to Wilbert. Water was certainly important to humans, so its usefulness to aliens seemed unsurprising, even if it was useful to aliens for very different reasons.

As Wilbert thought about the water and the hydrogen, BBR decided to steer the conversation back to their negotiation, because she still had one important objective Wilbert hadn't agreed to.

"Wilbert, soon I will provide you with detailed instructions, and you will deliver to me a supply of water," BBR said, before shifting to her other concern, "At the same time however, there is something else I hope you will do."

"What is that," asked Wilbert.

BBR replied, "As I send you on your mission of delivery, I will request of you one other simultaneous favor. It is not strictly necessary, but it would surely be of great emotional importance to Burt."

Then, a light shone down ever brighter upon Remy. Wilbert looked towards the light, towards Remy, as BBR spoke.

"This favor concerns the welfare of Burt's adopted friend, who you call Remy."

Wilbert looked at Remy as BBR went on.

"To you I hope I may entrust her care. I ask that you watch over her, but more importantly, I ask that you simply be *with* her, near her, as a companion and friend in this world so alien to her.

"Proper companionship is the one thing *I* cannot offer her, but it is exactly that which she needs most. She may frustrate you to some degree, but as the days pass, I hope you will find her to be as special as Burt did."

"Why exactly would she frustrate me?" asked Wilbert with suspicion.

BBR answered the question, "She can be the sweetest creature at times, but I must warn you, she is often found by others to be maddeningly indifferent."

Wilbert raised an eyebrow looking at Remy, and started to worry just a little. Then BBR continued.

"Those around her usually find that she rarely *seems* to care about anything at all, other than her instantaneous affections, or the pursuit of her moment-to-moment desires. Her mood may swing wildly, in ways incomprehensible to you.

"You make her sound like my family's cat," Wilbert commented.

BBR agreed, "Yes, in a sense, she is like an exaggeration of the 'cat' animals of your world. However, when her indifference is fully expressed, it is on a scale well beyond any Earth cat's capabilities."

Wilbert puzzeled about this as BBR's explaination went on.

"Her biology is somewhat unique, as she is only *optionally* affected by forces. They apply to her only when she so chooses. She is unmovable when she wishes to be stationary, and unstoppable when she wishes to proceed. All of this she does by instinct, and she controls her abilities with precision, even if she doesn't understand how she performs such feats."

Wilbert started to understand her very strange abilities earlier, "Ooooh... That's why she goes through walls and seems to float down after jumping. She's ignoring the forces of electromagnetism and gravity..."

Wilbert interrupted himself halfway through he own sentence, as he startled himself with an additional understanding. Wilbert realized that Remy's abilities must have extended beyond her own body as well, because she'd slipped the collar off Ms Kitty simply by poking at it with her head. Remy was now wearing that collar, without ever having unbuckled it from Ms. Kitty's neck.

Then Wilbert spoke more precisely about her earlier invisibility, "Earlier, in my barn, that's why she looked clear. Because light was going through her."

BBR confirmed Wilbert's suspicions, "Yes. You are correct."

Then, BBR explained some of benefits that came with Remy's special abilities, "Fortunately Remy's abilities can be quite convenient for her, because she is rarely in danger and she is easy to keep in good health. Her personality is also one of self sufficiency. Her dependencies are more emotional than material."

"I guess that's good," said Wilbert. He imagined there were many advantages in being immune to the forces of reality.

BBR then attempted to portray Remy in the best light, while staying honest and hoping that Wilbert would be pursuaded to befriend Remy.

"Though she can be frustrating at times, she is not an evil creature. I have never found her to cause anyone serious harm. Instead she is merely playful, and sometimes teasing. Burt knows that deep down she is a loving spirit with the best of intentions. Her behavior is in many ways a sort of an act, even if her indifference can seem very convincing."

"Why would she be like that, acting that way?" asked Wilbert.

"Perhaps, simply because she *can* be," replied BBR, "The exact reasons for her behaviour and personality are a mystery to me. I know very little of her exact origins or life history. I have however made a few discoveries about her. It may interest you that she is most likely unnatural, and was probably engineered. I consider it likely that she was abandoned by her creator."

There was a pause, while Wilbert thought about all that he'd now learned. All of the earlier events were making a lot more sense now, and BBR's description of her matched up with his own observations pretty well.

Then BBR repeated her request, "Regardless, even if she is sometimes annoying, I would ask that you please take care of her, or at least provide her good company. Otherwise, on your world, she would be all alone."

Wilbert stared at Remy. He was sympathetic, and there was sadness in his eyes as he looked upon her. To Wilbert, the idea of Remy being all alone was truly concerning.

BBR made some final comments, "I know that Burt was always there for her, and he would have wanted someone else to be there for her in his absence. However, It can not be me, as I am not even truly a 'someone'. Though I am an excellent repair and safety mechanism, I am nothing more than cold calculations. My simulations of affection can never replace the real thing. True feelings are simply beyond my design. Please, make amends for my shortcomings. Be a friend to her, and provide the care that I cannot. I ask you this because Burt would want it so. Burt's love for Remy is unconditional. She is to him, as you would say, 'family'."

This was touching to Wilbert, and he considered the request. In all honestly, he had developed an almost immediate affection for Remy, and he did genuinely want to help her.  Unfortunately, at the same time, some of what BBR had told him was very troubling, and indicated that she might be more of a hassle than she was worth.

After a few moments of thought, Wilbert decided to take her in anyway. This also provided him with an opportunity to make another request of his own.

"Okay... I'll take her in. I'll look after her," said Wilbert, before adding a new condition to his agreement, "but I want one more thing."

"What is your request?" asked BBR.

Wilbert hesitated for a moment as he formulated his next sentence.  Wilbert knew what he was about to say was a real stretch, but he made the request anyway, "I want you to agree that you'll help me with my work, my creations. You'll help me with making things, especially making my spaceship."

Though Wilbert again worried his request would be a tough sell, it actually wasn't.  BBR really had no reason to object. There was no risk to Burt, and BBR knew that Burt would not object as long certain guidelines were followed. Any concerns were very minor, so BBR agreed to help Wilbert with his creations.

"I can certainly provide help for your creative endevours..." replied BBR, "Within my ethical guidelines."

Wilbert wondered if those guidelines would be a concern, but he didn't want to push his luck, so he made no comment about them. Really, Wilbert was just thrilled at this point anyway. For the second time, reaching an agreement had been much easier than Wilbert had expected. So, he decided to put his worries aside, and simply sought reassurance, asking about it one more time.

"You promise? You'll help me make my inventions?"

"Yes," BBR agreed, "Is this agreement now acceptable?"

Wilbert was ecstatic, and responded almost instantly, "Oh yeah, we got a deal! If you give me stuff and help me build, I'll definitely look after Remy."

BBR confirmed, "Then it is agreed. We have an arrangement."

BBR was quite satisfied, as she calculated that the arrangement would be of great benefit to both of them. Later, it would turn out that BBR's judgement was in fact correct. Even if there would eventually be some complications BBR didn't anticipate, the arrangement would ultimately be in Burt's best interest. It would in fact lead to the development of those who would eventually be closest to Burt, those who Burt would eventually come to consider his own family.

Thus, in mutal agreement the arrangement was made. In the future it was to be widely known simply as "The Arrangement". Although neither Wilbert nor BBR truly understood its ramifications at the time, The Arrangement was to become the core basis of world history going forward.

For the moment however, instead of thinking about the long term future, Wilbert's mind just raced with ideas. He imagined spaceships, ray guns, robots, and more. All the designs he'd ever envisioned suddenly seemed in reach. Wilbert wasn't exactly sure of every detail, but he finally had a real reason to believe his ideas were achievable. It would later turn out that he was right.

Before Wilbert could spend too much time thinking, BBR returned to her request for deliveries.

"Since we are in agreement on both matters, it is now time for you to fulfill your responsibilities and..."

Wilbert again interupted very quickly, as he routinely did, "Ok, so I can just go out and bring you back a bucket of Water. That's easy enough."

BBR corrected Wilbert immediately, "No Wilbert. The scale of my needs is much greater than you imagine. It would be insufficient even if you were to walk back and forth to the point of exhaustion."

"Fine," said Wilbert, "I'll get the garden hose and bring it in, or..."

"No," BBR forcefully explained. "I need *so* much more water than that. Clearly you still do not understand the scale of my needs. You must be quiet now. Listen as I explain."

BBR's tone became more relaxed again as she further explained, "Because I knew I was likely to need so much water, I prepared what you might call a makeshift solution. A tool if you will."

"What is it?" asked Wilbert.

The light that was pointing at Remy, narrowed, and focused onto a spot on the bedding around her.

"The tool is now a part of Remy's most treasured possession.  Since Remy has shown a love of her blanket, and since she has often carried her blanket with her in the past, I made a slight modification to it. I adapted an existing feature on it, which will facilitate the gathering and transport of water.

Remy has been either uninterested or incapable of understanding this tool, so it has been of little use in her possesion. However, I had hoped she might bring it to someone, or bring someone to it, and now that you are here, you can use this tool to deliver my needs. Please take it, then I will explain to you how it works."

Wilbert moved towards Remy's bed, knelt down to it, and asked "Uhhh... okay, but which blanket exactly do I grab? There's a bunch of them and they're all tangled."

BBR said only a few more short words, "In Remy's bed, one of the blankets is special. On it you will find..."

Just then, there was a horrible sound.  CRRRRRRASH!

Without warning, the voice of BBR crackled. Then, before Wilbert had time to wonder why, the light that was the representation of BBR turned into a horrible danger, shattering into a burst of sparkling shrapnel.

The source, the ball of light and energy that had represented BBR, turned out to be huge but far away. Luckily the distance gave Wilbert a moment to react before the shrapnel reached him. Wilbert shielded his face from the few pieces that hit, and it was a good thing he did. The shards springing forth from the shattering light were sharp and solid. Even though the few that hit Wilbert were tiny and lightweight, their speed gave them the potential to do real harm. As they crashed into Wilbert's raised arms, the shards tore through his thick sweater and reached his skin. The impact was enough to draw blood.

Wilbert cried out, though he was more in shock than in real pain. As the shard in his arm dissolved, he rolled sideways away from the bed. Then, he looked back at Remy just soon enough to see a massive second wave of shards falling back down from above.

Wilbert watched in terror as one huge shard crashed right down into Remy. He had to turn away quickly though, and he covered his face as the shards bounced and shattered off of the floor under and around her.

Wilbert was lucky, as the second wave of shards mostly missed him, but he worried for Remy.  He immediately rushed over to check on her.

Fortunately of course, she turned out to be just fine. As he should have expected, the shards had passed right through her, harmlessly. The largest falling shard was now underneath her, shattered into thousands of smaller pieces. The smallest of those pieces were already disolving away into her bed.

Although Remy was uninjured, she was certainly no longer relaxed. Instead she was now up and hyper alert. The raining shard-storm had her every bit as surprised and confused as Wilbert. Even though the shards were not directly dangerous to her, the situation was terrifying.

The last of the shards finally settled, and the danger seemed to have passed.  Still, Wilbert clung tightly to Remy and her bed.

They both stayed very still for a few more moments, clinging to each other. Wilbert realized how much he was trembling as he caught his breath. Though it wasn't the scariest thing that had ever happened to Wilbert, it was terrifying nonetheless, and this storm of shattering shards was certainly much worse than the storm outside his barn.

Everything was about to get a lot scarier.

In another sudden shocking burst of activity, the floor shook and became more uneven. Its tiny sparkles jittered and warped much more than ealier, becoming bright gliterring flashes of light. The floor started to like like some kind of metallic crystal.

Not only the floor, but all the structures in the distance started to take shape and become more visible. The surroundings no longer seemed like a dark fog everywhere, but more and more like a giant crumbling dome.

Wilbert wasn't sure, but as he checked the floor, he worried the new forming patterns underneath him looked like cracks. Was the floor breaking up?

Yes it was.  The very ground on which he stood was deteriorating quickly. Wilbert adjusted in shock as the floor dropped a couple of inches beneath him. In any moment, the floor was going to be gone. If the ground did give way, Wilbert couldn't even imagine what he'd be falling into underneath.

Suddenly, the voice of BBR came back! In one last effort to make up for her loss of control, she gave a final instruction, which was completely clear.

"Run!"
