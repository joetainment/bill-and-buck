Intermission - Wilbert's Suspension
======================================


Notice of Suspension<br>
May 25th, 1995

The administration of Utope Elementary School, hereby informs Rachael and Robert Watterson of changes in school policy regarding the student: Wilbert Watterson.

Wilbert will remain suspended from our school indefinitely.

We did not come to this decision lightly or quickly. For years, Wilbert has shown an extreme contempt for authority, and a total disregard for it. He has actively subverted school activities on more than one occasion, and disciplinary measures have proven to be unsuccessful in changing his behaviour.

Wilbert conceals his activities well enough that we can not even be sure to what extent Wilbert has undermined our institution. To this day, we continue to make new discoveries of Wilbert's pranks around the school.

Despite our efforts of mitigation, Wilbert's behavior has continuously worsened. The wrecklessness most recently demonstrated by Wilbert has fundamentally changed the nature of our concern. Last week's dangerous events were arguably caused by Wilbert, as were the subsequent injuries. Even if Wilbert did not intend such serious outcomes, these events indicate that we can no longer tolerate Wilbert's misbehavior. We must address safety risks, especially any involving fire and electricity.

In the interest of maintaining an orderly environment, and by the request of the other parents, Wilbert is hereby suspended from school indefinitely. He will remain suspended until we can be sure his behavior will be appropriate for a school environment.

If Wilbert remains in school there will likely continue to be significant conflict between Wilbert, his teachers, and his peers. Removing Wilbert from the school environment seems to be the best solution for all involved, including Wilbert himself.

We recommend that Wilbert participate in a professional youth counselling program, and attached to this letter you will find a referral to such a program. We have already notified Social Services and we expect that they will get in touch with you shortly.

Please contact us if you have any questions, but note that this decision will not be reconsidered, it is absolutely final.

Sincerely,

<br>

Principal Keaton

Re: Suspension of Wilbert Waterson

Robert Watterson,

We do acknowledge that Wilbert's misbehavior is in part a reaction to the bullying Wilbert experienced from other students at our school. However, this fact does not excuses his misbehavior.

Again, our decision is absolutely final. Wilbert remains suspended from our school.
