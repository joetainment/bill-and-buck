<h1>Chapter 1 - Burt Makes A Mistake</h1>

<p><br></p>

<p>The start of our story (and really the heart of our story) begins with a little frog named Burt. Though he hadn't been named "Burt" yet, and he wasn't necessarily "little" at the time, nor was he exactly a "frog".</p>

<p>It's all a bit tricky to explain.</p>

<p>You see, back before Burt turned into a frog, Burt was a spaceship. A spaceship that did, kind of, look like a frog.</p>

<p>Burt wasn't just any spaceship either. He was the best kind! Burt was a special sort of spaceship, a "space folding" spaceship. He could fold space pretty much any way he wanted, and he was rather good at squishing and stretching space as well.</p>

<p>By folding space, stretching, and sometimes squishing it a little, Burt could go anywhere he wanted, almost instantly!</p>

<p>One of the more interesting effects of this was that Burt was rarely the same size. Sometimes Burt ended up bigger, and sometimes he ended up smaller. </p>

<p>Burt was of <em>inconsistent size</em>.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p>So...</p>

<p>Burt, the frog-like spaceship, was flying through space, zipping about the galaxies, the way frog-like spaceships often do.</p>

<p>As usual, Burt had been growing and shrinking.  In fact, just moments earlier he'd been a much tinier Burt, exploring much smaller places, since the inner workings of atoms are fun places to play.</p>

<p>Frankly though, Burt was worn out. The entanglings of his tiny playground had been a bit much for Burt. Even though he was now bigger again, and enjoying his exciting trek around the stars, Burt was getting very tired.</p>

<p>As a result, Burt was growing careless.</p>

<p>Careless flying isn't really a good idea, especially because darting about the galaxies is actually surprisingly complicated. It's easy to forget a space fold here or a squash-and-stretch there.</p>

<p>The thing about galaxies, and even the stars and planets in them, is that there are just so many of them. It's really easy to lose count.  Yep, it can be a real challenge keeping up with all of them. If your space folding gets sloppy, if you fail to account for just one tiny little galaxy off in the corner of the universe...</p>

<p>Oh no!  Your whole plan goes sideways real fast,  and well... things break.</p>

<p>Now of course, in day-to-day life, things go wrong and things break all the time. For example: If you're riding a skateboard and you get distracted, you might break something, but it's usually not that bad, because skateboards just don't go that fast.</p>

<p>Spaceships, however, go very fast! (Much faster than skateboards.) So when Burt forgot about that one little galaxy, Burt fell out of his space folds, and he fell <em>hard</em>.</p>

<p>As Burt fell, the rugged folds sprung flat, and launched him like a cannonball. Burt was violently ejected from the wrinkly mess he'd made of space-time.</p>

<p>That's why Burt crashed so hard, and that's why Burt was so badly broken. Crashing into unfolded space time is a lot like riding a skateboard into a brick wall, but at nearly the speed of light.  Things can be expected to break.</p>

<p>Now Burt is a pretty tough space frog. Always has been... but even tough guys have their limits. Burt was <em>way</em> past his, and when you go way past your limits, especially when you do it carelessly, you tend to break.</p>

<p>And so it was, that Burt was broken, and not just any one part of Burt either. Many of his parts were broken.</p>

<p>Burt broke his engines, he broke his radios, he broke his shields, and he broke his sensors... the list went on and on.  Burt even broke the most important part of all... his brain.</p>

<p>Burt's brain was very very broken.</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>Being so injured, Burt wasn't thinking very clearly. Really, he was barely thinking at all. As his damage reached critical levels, it all became too much for Burt, and he passed out unconscious and into a deep sleep. Being asleep, Burt's brain was no longer very useful.</p>

<p>Fortunately like all great spaceship frogs, Burt had a backup brain! Many backups in fact!</p>

<p>Less fortunately, most of his backups were broken too. Only one, out of the hundreds of backups Burt had, was still working at all, and even that one was mostly broken.</p>

<p>It was the most simple and rugged backup in Burt's entire body. It was more of a computer than a brain really. Because of it's relative simplicity, it remained at least partially intact. In those moments after the crash, it became Burt's only working intellegence.</p>

<p>Burt's backup brain was eventually named, Bee-bee-arr, so for now we'll just call it that too.   "Backup Brain R".  B.B.R.    Bee-bee-arr.</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>Burt himself stayed fast asleep, and so, Bee-bee-arr was now doing the thinking on Burt's behalf.</p>

<p>As Bee-bee-arr began to appraise its situation, it noted that "mostly broken" was still better than "totally broken", so things could have been much worse.</p>

<p>Bee-bee-arr continued to ponder its situation. It looked around through Burt's damaged sensors, his "eyes".</p>

<p>Simple forms and colors could be seen, but they were awfully blurry. Straining to see through the murky depths of Burt's senses, Bee-bee-arr could faintly make out a pale blue dot.</p>

<!--(The storm of virtual particles washing over Burts face weren't helping either.) -->

<p>A place to land perhaps!</p>

<p>Gently but firmly, using what little strength it could muster from Burt's broken body, Bee-bee-arr fired the engines and thrusted towards that dot.</p>

<p>As it got closer the pale blue dot turned out to be a planet!</p>

<p>So Bee-bee-arr took the next step in Burt's journey... careening towards, and eventually falling into, what turned out to be a very beautiful world.</p>

<p>Burt fell into a planet that was third from its sun. A planet with clouds and seas, rivers and trees. A planet Burt would later learn was called Earth, and a place Burt would eventually call home.</p>

<p>As Burt blasted down through the Earth's sky, he slowed until he finally crashed into a little farm field,</p>

<p>in a place known as Vancouver Island, <br>
in a province called BC, <br>
in a country called Canada, <br>
in the year 1995. <br></p>

<p>Really, all things considered, this wasn't a bad place to be. One of the nicest places he could have hoped for actually.</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>By the time Burt finally hit the ground, Bee-bee-arr had used what was left of the brakes, and had mostly slown Burt down, so it was a pretty soft landing. The gentle dirt of the farm field had a nice new trough, but there wasn't much of a crater.</p>

<p>Burt had crashed about as cleanly as a spaceship frog could be expected to.</p>

<p>Even though Burt had slowed down quite a bit, the crash was still pretty loud. The dominant creatures living in the area, (humans they were called), could have heard it even in the farm house across the the fields.</p>

<p>Luckily for Burt, the only grown-up humans in the area weren't in any state to care, as they'd been drinking for quite some time. Nobody would come running to check up on the loud crash, because no one could be bothered to.</p>

<p>So there Burt sat, waiting and recovering, healing towards a slightly less dysfunctional state, even if it would take months or years for Burt to feel better again.</p>

<p>It wasn't very exciting, but it wasn't boring either. Burt just slept through the whole process as he slowly got better.</p>

<p>Bee-bee-arr continued doing its job, sorting out and fixing things so it could wake Burt up again when things were ready.</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>Burt sat alone in that farm field for quite some time, but he wasn't truly alone, he simply hadn't been discovered yet. All the while, a little boy was nearby, mucking about the farm, which was the boy's home.</p>

<p>With muddy boots and squeaky wagon wheels, every day the boy criss-crossed the farm until one day, he finally stumbled upon the green spaceship. </p>

<p>Bee-bee-arr could hear the boy coming, though Burt was still fast asleep as the boy approached. Even if Burt had been awake, he was too weak to defend himself or to flee. The most Burt could have done was hope that the little human was friendly.</p>

<p>But alas!</p>

<p>The little human was not friendly.</p>

<p>This little human was worse than unfriendly.</p>

<p>This little human, it would eventually turn out, was downright mean.</p>

<p><br><br></p>

<p>The little human boy approached Burt, and upon reaching his discovery, the boy pulled out a long slip of paper with a sticky coating on its backside. (A "sticker", as Burt would later discover it was called.)</p>

<p>With a slap of his hand, the boy affixed the paper to the side of Burt's hull. Then, with a wave of his arm, the boy revealed a colorful cylinder, which he promptly used to scribble something onto the sticker.</p>

<p>Burt was now wearing a sign. Burt had been labeled.</p>

<p>Burt was in no state to read them yet, but the paper and its new scribbles had a clear message, one that set the tone for Burt's months to follow. The text on Burt's side now proudly declared a new truth:</p>

<p>"Property of Wilbert"</p>
