<h1>Chapter 9 - In Good Faith</h1>

<p><br></p>

<p>The voice of the light in the dark had spoken, and it sounded like it said "Burt". However, the sound was too complicated and alien to really be any human word. </p>

<p>Perhaps Wilbert interpreted the sound the way he did because of its similarity to a part of his own name. One way or another though, even if the sound wasn't truly an identifiable word, Wilbert assumed it to be one. In his mind, his spaceship had simply said, "Burt".</p>

<p>Since his spaceship had made a self introduction, Wilbert decided to do the same. He repeated his words of first contact from before, but this time he put special emphasis on the first half of his name.</p>

<p>"I am Wil-bert," he said, "and you're just Burt?" </p>

<p>"Yes", a woman's voice replied. It was a voice that spoke with the sound of ages past, somewhat in the spirit of old English, with a kind of intellectual but booming authority. In a way, her voice was as beautiful as it was awe inspiring.</p>

<p>"Burt... your interpretation of a waveform derived from a mathematical identifier." </p>

<p>There was a pause, and then Wilbert spoke, mostly to himself. "What?... What is that supposed to mean?"</p>

<p>Wilbert would have figured it out quickly enough, but before Wilbert could think much more about it, his spaceship continued, "Burt, the living vessel in which you find yourself now."</p>

<p>Wilbert collected himself, and stood up to face the ball of light. Then he realized how astonished he was that he'd actually received a spoken reply. He followed up quickly with another question, one that was immediately relevant.</p>

<p>"Wait... you speak English?" he asked, puzzled by the voice's use of the familiar language.</p>

<p>The voice answered without much hesitation, "I do speak the languages of your world. At least, those spoken in years past. My knowledge of your world's past is extensive."</p>

<p>"You know my planet?" asked Wilbert. </p>

<p>"Yes," replied the voice, "I know of Earth. However, its identity as the planet Burt now finds himself on is something I only now understand. During the crash, my senses were in such disarray. I could barely ascertain where Burt was headed. The moment I observed you, it became obvious that this was Earth, because you are a human, and Earth is the habitat of humans."</p>

<p>OK, OK... thought Wilbert, trying to mentally sort through everything he'd just heard. Some of it made sense, but a part of it didn't, so Wilbert kept asking questions.</p>

<p>"You know of human's and you speak of Burt... but you talk about him as if he's someone else." </p>

<p>The voice of Wilbert's spaceship clarified, "This is true, for I am not truly Burt. I am only his representative, and his temporary guardian. Of all Burt's thinking systems, I am the last left functional."</p>

<p>Wilbert's question repeated the idea in his own words, "Thinking system? So are you one of Burt's... brains?"</p>

<p>The spaceship confirmed, "In a sense, perhaps. I am the eighteenth in my particular family of coprocessor systems, meant to take control in the event of Burt's injury."</p>

<p>Again, Wilbert spoke back and communicated the idea in his own words, "Ok, so you're backup-brain eighteen?"</p>

<p>Wilbert did some quick mental math and visualized the alphabet. Then he put forward a proposal, "Or, maybe, since the eighteenth letter is R...  You can be  Backup Brain R... 
B... B... R... ? "</p>

<p>The spaceship, which Wilbert had now mentally labeled as BBR (Bee-Bee-Arr), responded with indifference. "If you wish. Though, in spirit, I am more of a computational system than a brain. My actual workings are nothing like those of Burt's. I am quite deterministic. In fact, it is only my relative simplicity that has allowed me to continue operating as Burt's guardian."</p>

<p>The nature of the spaceship's voice was starting to become clear to Wilbert. He summarized his thoughts, "So...  This spaceship itself is Burt and you are B.B.R, now looking after Burt?"</p>

<p>"Correct," replied BBR.</p>

<p>Still, Wilbert wanted to know more, "But why are you looking after him?  Is he in danger?" </p>

<p>If BBR could have enjoyed comedy, she would have laughed. Instead she gave a very matter of fact reply.</p>

<p>"Presently, there is only one thing in your universe that is of any danger to Burt. That singular danger is Burt himself.  It was only due to his own mistake, his careless playfulness, that he even came to be here.</p>

<p>"The only reason for his injuries was that Burt didn't just crash into your Earth. Burt crashed into the very fabric of this reality. It was only afterwards that I guided him to the surface of your planet. Now I guide him through the process of healing. I do this because even though Burt would heal without me, it would take an unfathomable amount of time. For Burt, it would not be a pleasant experience."</p>

<p>Wilbert took a few moments, absorbing the information.  It was a lot to take in.</p>

<p>"Wow... this is wild," said Wilbert, "But I think I understand." Then he pointed to his companion, the little raccoon,  "Still... what in the universe is Remy supposed to be?"</p>

<p>"Remy?" asked BBR, before continuing on anyway, "I assume you mean this little one, Burt's most valued passenger."</p>

<p>"Yes," replied Wilbert. "If she is such a valuable passenger, who is she?  What is she?  Where is she from?"</p>

<p>BBR educated Wilbert on the origin of Remy, the passenger.</p>

<p>"She is a creature from your reality, but she is from very very far away. Trillions of times farther than the edge of your observable universe. She is a "rescue" of a sort. Burt found her all alone, floating in space, an orphan of her world. She is now Burt's friend, or perhaps as you might say, his pet."</p>

<p>The voice's ball of light pulsed, and a cone of light briefly shone upon Remy in her bed. It caused her to perk up for a moment, looking towards it, and then to Wilbert. She made an attempt at something resembling a smile, and then relaxed again.</p>

<p>"Ok... I think I already understood that part about her being like a pet...  But here, where she sleeps...  Where are we?" asked Wilbert. "What is the place?" </p>

<p>"This is a home, a home for our passenger, 'Remy' as you call her. This space was made to be manipulated by her, and is one of the only parts of Burt that hasn't become totally uninhabitable. Though nearly everything here was lost, I was able to protect her in that small bed she lies upon. The rest of her surroundings are gone though, lost somewhere far off in this hyperbolic space."</p>

<p>Wilbert didn't quite understand what hyperbolic space was precisely, but he knew a little about it from reading astronomy books about the curvature of space, and Wilbert got the distinct suspicion that it had something to do with his earlier turning in circles. He decided not to focus on that though. Instead he continued his questions about Remy.</p>

<p>"But why did she bring me here?" Wilbert asked, still quite confused, though gradually making sense of his situation.</p>

<p>BBR summarized the story of Remy's isolation.</p>

<p>"Though Remy could not understand the reasons, after sleeping so long alone in the darkness, she could feel that something was not right. With my encouragement, she finally decided to go outside."</p>

<p>Wilbert looked towards Remy with a saddened face, feeling a bit sorry for her.</p>

<p>BBR continued, "Wilbert... Remy was right to go, and she somehow even had the sense to bring back help, or at least company, because she brought back <em>you</em>. Whether or not she intended to bring help, it was good that she did, because help is needed. The situation is grave, so you must listen."</p>

<p>Wilbert listened very carefully as BBR continued to explain. </p>

<p>"For a long time, longer than you realize, my condition has been deteriorating. I've had the ability to do little more than project fragments of communication to Remy. Encouraging her to finally wake up and explore outside has been the most I could do."</p>

<p>It struck Wilbert deeply that this incredible being was now so powerless, so he asked, "You can't do <em>anything</em>?"</p>

<p>BBR explained the situation further, "Essentially, no. My control over Burt's body has been cut. I have not even the power to heal my failing self. At times I have found enough control to warp the relationship between Burt's space and your own, but even those successes have been minimal."</p>

<p>Wilbert thought he understood, but asked just to confirm, "You mean the growing and the shrinking?"</p>

<p>"Correct," replied BBR. </p>

<p>Again, Wilbert asked about the reasoning, "Ok, so you made Burt bigger and smaller, but why?"</p>

<p>"The actions were part of my attempts at reaching some level of control. Unfortunately it was counterproductive.  My control over Burt's body is now even less than it was during the crash. I have been getting worse ever since."</p>

<p>The voice of Wilbert's spaceship, BBR, was beginning to seem less authoritative and more vulnerable. She continued, "Of little relevance is the growing and shrinking. In the end, its only use turned out to be the accommodation of Remy's exit.  For Burt himself, these efforts have proved pointless. Not only have I failed to take action, but I have failed to connect the senses as well. I still cannot even see what lies beyond Burt's body."</p>

<p>"You can't even see outside?" Wilbert asked, very surprised. He mentally noted his earlier thoughts about navigating a ship with no windows. </p>

<p>BBR confirmed her visual limitations, "No. Since the crash, I have been completely cut off from the outside world. My vision went out watching the blurring of your world. Apart from having crashed in a field on Earth, I know not where we are anymore."</p>

<p>"Well I can tell you," said Wilbert, "We're in my spaceship in my workshop, my barn."</p>

<p>Wilbert did not fully realize what he'd implied, but BBR's reaction was quick and forceful. </p>

<p>"Of this you are mistaken. Though Burt may be in your barn, he is not in your possession. Burt is certainly not your spaceship. Nor is he mine."</p>

<p>Wilbert was slightly startled, and stepped back. In his heart, Wilbert reacted quite emotionally to the words he'd just heard. This was the first thing said by BBR that really made Wilbert angry.  He'd really had his heart set on having his own spaceship, and his dream was at risk of being shattered.</p>

<p>"But this was going to be my spaceship!" Wilbert snapped back.</p>

<p>BBR seemed to take little notice of his reaction, instead she just went on. "Now Wilbert, you must help us. Actions are needed. Remy will not understand, and in my deteriorating condition, it will not be long before I fail. Time is running short."</p>

<p>BBR paused, and looked upon Wilbert. Even to BBR herself, it was immediately obvious that she had spoken unwisely.</p>

<p>It no longer mattered what plight she expressed. Wilbert didn't care, not anymore.</p>

<p>Wilbert's anger, his fear of losing his spaceship, started to boil over. For the first time in the encounter, he became confrontational.</p>

<p>"Why should I?" Wilbert exclaimed, in defiance.</p>

<p>Then he started to really get into it, "Why should I believe you?  How do I know anything you're saying is true? For all I know, you're trying to trick me. Maybe you're even about to do something horrible."</p>

<p>In response, BBR remained factual, while attempting to console Wilbert, "I may not intentionally harm any human earthling. It is forbidden. Nor will I lie to you or trick you. It is not my way."</p>

<p>Even though Wilbert had the feeling BBR was trustworthy, Wilbert countered quickly, "You say that, but why <em>should</em> I trust you? You might be about to zap me with some kind of ray gun, or turn into a terrible monster and eat me alive!" </p>

<p>BBR conceded the point, "In truth, there is no reason you should believe me. You have only my word."</p>

<p>There was a long awkward silence, but in his stalling, Wilbert was clever. Before long he had a powerful idea. It was an idea that would have unimaginable ramifications.</p>

<p>With this idea, Wilbert would manipulate BBR, by proposing a hypothetical, before asking one more very leading question.</p>

<p>"Let's say, just for the moment, that I trust you. That doesn't mean I have to help you.  No!   You have to tell me...  <em>Why</em> should I?"</p>

<p>BBR understood what was required. Her voice took a more humble tone, attempting to disarm Wilbert, and she replied.</p>

<p>"I have no immediate answer. Instead, perhaps we can assist each other, acting in good faith. So I must ask, in return for your assistance...  What do you want?"</p>

<p>This offer, given so easily, was unexpected by Wilbert. He'd imagined more resistance. His plan was already working better than he'd hoped.</p>

<p>Wilbert had surmised, correctly, that BBR was in a weak negotiating position, but also that there was materially little to gain from a powerless projection in an empty void. Currently, with such limited abilities, BBR could do little for him. However, there was one thing Wilbert could ask for, something immaterial, but so much more valuable.</p>

<p>Even if he couldn't have <em>this</em> spaceship, there was a way he could have <em>a</em> spaceship. It didn't matter if BBR was in no position to provide him one. </p>

<p>"I know what I want," said Wilbert.</p>

<p>Then he paused just long enough to purposefully add weight to his words.</p>

<p>"If I have to make my own spaceship, I'll need to understand. That's what I want from you," Wilbert said, before continuing to clarify his demand.</p>

<p>"I want to understand <em>everything</em>."</p>
