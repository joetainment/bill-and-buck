<h1>Chapter 13 <br> Preparations</h1>

<p>The sun was just starting to rise, but Wilbert was already wide awake and preparing for his journey.</p>

<p>He was in a surprisingly good mood considering how badly he'd been hurt the night before. Most children his age (and even most adults) would still have been writhing in pain, but Wilbert was an especially tough and determined little boy. Pain was something he was well accustomed to, tolerated easily, and was rarely afraid of. (Too rarely, his father would say.)</p>

<p>What Wilbert was really afraid of were storms, but by morning, the storms had mostly broken up. Thick dark clouds still hung above, but there were now cracks between them revealing spots of clear blue scattered in the sky.</p>

<p>In a way, the weather was quite beautiful, the sort that only comes right after a storm: Brief periods of sprinkling rain falling through a cool mist in the air. Rainbows could be easily spotted.</p>

<p>For Wilbert though, all that was important was that the storm had passed, It didn't appear to be coming back anytime soon.</p>

<p>So, instead of worrying about the weather, Wilbert was focused on his plans for the day. He was busy making preparations.</p>

<p>Being busy was typical of Wilbert, but that morning he kept an especially brisk pace. Even though he was sore and tired from the night before, Wilbert was in a great mood. He felt absolutely wired, excited, and motivated.</p>

<p>Hope is what had Wilbert so inspired. He was hopeful because he finally believed he was making real progress. He even had a plan. It all felt so exciting!</p>

<p>As part of his plan, Wilbert was preparing for a journey, or perhaps more precisely, preparing for a quest.</p>

<p>He wasn't certain of the specifics of his quest, but he had an idea of the broad strokes. He understood his goals and had some idea of what actions to take.</p>

<p>Wilbert had gone over last nights events in his head, being careful to be clear and specific in his thinking. The night before, Remy had led Wilbert into the spaceship. There Wilbert had met BBR, a voice in the darkness, who had actually identified herself as a backup computer system for Burt, the living spaceship. BBR had told Wilbert that she was taking care of Burt because Burt was injured, and that in order to help Burt heal, BBR needed Wilbert's help to retrieve water, and she had pointed out that Remy's blanket was to be used for that purpose. Wilbert has also investigated the blanket and figured out how to gather water using it. Somehow the blanket seemed to either process the water or send it away somewhere, since the blanket didn't get heavy, or seem to fill up, no matter how much water Wilbert poured into it.</p>

<p>As a result of this line of thinking, Wilbert was fairly confident that he needed to complete two steps:</p>

<p>A)  Find water     ...and...</p>

<p>B)  Get it into the blanket</p>

<p>How much water exactly? That was the one detail Wilbert didn't yet understand. Wilbert had no idea just how much he'd need, but he remembered what he had been told by BBR: That it was much more than a garden hose could supply.</p>

<p>Fortunately, in terms of finding water, Wilbert had had no shortage of options. There was so much everywhere around him.</p>

<p>Streams, creeks, rivers, lakes... the ocean even.</p>

<p>Where Wilbert lived (Vancouver Island) water was everywhere. In fact, the island got so much rain that areas of it were officially classified as "rainforests".</p>

<p>Wilbert had even more water around than usual that morning, because rain had been pouring out of the sky all night. All that fallen water would now be dripping into the rivers around him, headed for the lakes and then on to the ocean.</p>

<p>Some of that water even ran as a stream just behind the farmhouse, where Wilbert's parents were and where Willbert usually slept in his bedroom. Outside that bedroom's window a trickling stream ran around the backyard, and through a pipe under the driveway.</p>

<p>That stream in Wilbert's backyard was very small though. There were better, larger, sources nearby. Easily found in the backwoods behind his farm were streams flowing from the mountains, winding through the hills before feeding into a much larger stream, the nearby Cameron River.</p>

<p>At first Wilbert wasn't sure just which of those streams he should go to, but after some consideration he decided that ideally, he'd want a wide shallow stream that would make it easy for him to wade out into the water. He'd also want to avoid anything with a strong current, so that he could place the blanket without losing it.</p>

<p>After much consideration Wilbert had decided to head into the forest at the back of his farm, where he knew of a widening brook that would be an ideal spot to put the blanket.  Even if that brook ended up not being enough water, Wilbert knew the trails through the forest could take him to more streams, to the river, or even where it ultimately led to a huge lake nearby, called Cameron Lake.</p>

<p>All of that consideration had given Wilbert a clear goal, and in pursuit of his goal, Wilbert had made some last minute preparations.</p>

<p>First he'd gone to the farmhouse and gathered some food and drinks for the day. Then Wilbert had put on the warmest clothes in his closet, and even grabbed his raincoat from the basement. (All of which were clearly labeled "Property Of Wilbert".)</p>

<p>The whole while, as Wilbert rummaged around the house, his parent's simply slept, most likely having passed out the night before.</p>

<p>So, by the time the sun was rising, Wilbert was just wrapping up at the house and headed back to his workshop. He had warm clothes, snacks, drinks and everything else he could need, all carried in a knapsack on his back.</p>

<p>Wilbert headed for the front door, cautiously looked outside, and was satisfied as he confirmed the weather was still improving.</p>

<p>After looking back for one last check, Wilbert stepped outside, onto the front porch.</p>

<p>Immediately Wilbert could feel the cold air.  It was fairly typical for an October day. It wasn't freezing but it certainly wasn't warm either.</p>

<p>Wilbert walked across his porch and out from under the awning. Then, he looked up at the sky.</p>

<p>Even in this new morning, the clouds around Wilbert's farm still looked as though they could deliver a torrential downpour. The thick clouds worried him slightly, but overall, Wilbert was simply pleased that the wind had settled down from the night before. He was glad the rain had stopped as well, at least for the moment. His traveling was going to be easier if the rain wasn't blasting in his face.</p>

<p>Feeling confident, he walked down the farm road towards his workshop.</p>

<p>It wasn't more than a few minutes walk, but it was a considerable distance considering how often he went back and forth between the farmhouse and his workshop.</p>

<p>As Wilbert walked, he passed the remains of the once thriving farm. The abandoned buildings, the motionless tractors, the empty trucks, his playground, his sandbox, and the piles of junk nearby. Finally he arrived at his old barn.</p>

<p>Once he got there he unlocked the door and went inside. The first thing he saw was Remy, curled up on her blanket, sleeping right where he'd left her.</p>

<p>Remy woke up a little, hearing his footsteps, and watched as Wilbert walked to the storage area across from his desk, disappearing into its labyrinth of shelves and junk. After a lot of noise and shuffling around, he emerged with his mountain bike and a steel cargo bin to use as a basket. Its sides look like a chain link fence.</p>

<p>Wilbert stood the bike by his desk and flipped out the kickstand. Then he grabbed some tools and fastened the basket to the cargo rack on the rear of his mountain bike.</p>

<p>With that, he was fully prepared. All that remained was to grab Remy and the blanket.</p>

<p>Carefully, he lifted both Remy and her blanket, then put them into the basket on his bike.</p>

<p>Remy was mildly annoyed with being moved, but she allowed it.</p>

<p>In her new spot, Remy fell back asleep as Wilbert made some final adjustments to the blanket and the basket around her.</p>

<p>Carefully Wilbert started rolling the bike forward. He really wasn't sure how Remy would react to the bike ride but he hoped she'd be okay.</p>

<p>As Wilbert walked his bike outside, through the large main doors of the barn, he looked down into the basket, watching Remy carefully. So far she did seem okay.</p>

<p>Wilbert came to a stop outside the barn, still looking over Remy in her blanket, the peculiarity of it caught his eye. He leaned over to take a closer look.</p>

<p>Even after sitting on the dusty dingy floor of the barn, the blanket's underside looked perfectly, impossibly, clean. It was an object so out of touch with its environment that it looked like it couldn't be real.</p>

<p>In the dark, it had looked incredible with its glowing, sparkling, and iridescence, but now in the light of morning it was an entirely new kind of amazing. It was beautiful, but more subtle than the night before.</p>

<p>The blanket now looked more like fabric then it had in the dark. The light around it was bright enough that the sparkling was no longer noticeable. The iridescence was still obvious though, as the colors shifted with the angle of the light. Underneath that iridescence, the base colors slowly changed as well, as gentle waves of shifting hues washed across, and subtle patterns of both color and texture on its surface seemed to come and go. Mostly though, apart from the fact that it kept changing, the blanket looked like a sort of silk, and maybe a little like aluminum foil.</p>

<p>Wilbert pushed his finger into it to feel the surface more carefully. It certainly didn't feel anything like aluminum foil. It was soft and very smooth. He could easily slide his fingers across it, but when he squeezed his fingers there was enough friction that he could grip it easily. It certainly wasn't going to slip out of his hands.</p>

<p>Wilbert nodded with a smile, since the blanket slipping out of his hands had been an earlier concern. Now he was fairly sure that wouldn't be a problem.</p>

<p>As he looked over the blanket, Wilbert pet Remy, making sure was comfortable. By comparison to it, she appeared remarkably normal, like a very expensive plush toy animal. As long as she didn't move, any passer-bys would probably assume she was a toy animal. Perhaps, thought Wilbert, it was fortunate she spent so much time sleeping, though he wondered how long that would last.</p>

<p>Before leaving, Wilbert did feel a slight hesitation. Being somewhat reckless, he'd been in his share of crashes over the years, and the last one had been fairly dangerous. Lately, he'd spent most of his outdoor time walking with his wagon, collecting things around the farm.</p>

<p>Today though, Wilbert knew his wagon wouldn't get him far enough. Instead, his bike would take him as far as he wanted to go. The only limit was how hard Wilbert was willing to peddle. The bike could take him all the way to the ocean if he needed it to, though Wilbert hoped he wouldn't.</p>

<p>So even though he would have preferred four wheels to two, Wilbert decided to go.</p>

<p>Grabbing the handlebars and gently nudging forward, Wilbert started to ride. Occasionally stopping to look back and watching Remy to see her reaction. Remy had perked up, and was definitely interested in what was happening around her, but she remained calm. Wilbert hoped she'd stay that way on the bumpy road ahead.</p>

<p>Now with both his passenger and his cargo in good shape to go, Wilbert finally got moving at pace. He picked up speed and set out towards the mountains, south-west of his farm.</p>

<p>His quest was now underway.</p>
