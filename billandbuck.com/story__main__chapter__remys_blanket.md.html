<h1>Chapter 12 <br> Remy's Blanket</h1>

<p>Wilbert was dead... or at least it seemed that way to Remy.</p>

<p>Only minutes earlier, Remy had been thrilled that she'd been able to rescue both of them from the spaceship.</p>

<p>Now though, Remy was panicked. Her only friend in the universe was lying limp in front of her. She poked and prodded at Wilbert's body, hoping desperately that he would be okay.</p>

<p>Luckily for them, Wilbert was going to be fine. Though he'd taken a pretty hard knock, it wasn't truly life threatening. Within a few minutes, he started to awaken.</p>

<p>Wilbert woke up at a very slow pace.  Somewhat dazed,all that he perceived at first was vague feelings. His sore skull and significant headache being the most obvious.</p>

<p>Then, sounds came into his awareness. Wilbert could hear pattering rain and howling wind, which had quieted somewhat from the worst of the storm.</p>

<p>Gradually he became more aware of his environment, and finally opened his eyes. It was still very dark, but Wilbert could tell he was in his workshop, lying on the floor facing the ceiling.</p>

<p>As he regained consciousness, memories caught his attention. Soon he remembered most of what had happened in the ship, but he remained very confused regarding how he'd escaped. The last thing he could remember was falling through the darkness in the spaceship.</p>

<p>For a moment it crossed his mind that maybe he'd been dreaming, but as he thought a little harder he was fairly sure it wasn't a dream. He soon became certain, because as he began to move his body he was able to look around, and sure enough, right beside him was Remy with her blanket, which was mesmerizing. Not only did the blanket sparkle, but its surface gave off a dim glow all over. That glow washed around the blanket's surface, in a beautiful flow like the motion of a lava lamp. The blanket was so incredible to look at, that it was clearly not something from his workshop.</p>

<p>Seeing the blanket was a clue for Wikbert. What happened earlier had not been a dream, he reasoned, because if the blanket was real, then the events in the spaceship were probably real as well.</p>

<p>Wilbert stared at Remy, who was illuminated by the glow of the blanket. Remy stared back at him intently. She'd been doing so for a while. It had been almost 20 minutes since she'd dragged him out of the spaceship. All that time, Remy had been extremely worried. Now she was so relieved to see that Wilbert was okay. She nuzzled up to Wilbert as he began to sit up from lying on the floor.</p>

<p>Remy appeared flustered to Wilbert, so he gradually stroked Remy's neck and back, in an attempt to soothe her. As he calmed Remy, Wilbert considered how he'd gotten back to the barn. He felt very lucky that he even made it out of the spaceship alive.</p>

<p>Wilbert reasoned that since Remy had the blanket now, she must have rescued it from the darkness in the spaceship. He understood that Remy had probably rescued him as well.</p>

<p>"Thanks Remy..." he said, "You're the reason I made it out aren't you?"</p>

<p>Remy didn't understand the meaning of the words, but she picked up on the warm sentiment anyway, and in response gently nudged Wilbert again with her nose.</p>

<p>Wilbert was relieved to see that Remy was starting to calm down. Before long though, he realized that her own situation was now extremely sad. The last things Wllbert remembered from inside the spaceship were the crashes and the shatterings in the darkness. As far as Wilbert could tell, that shattering darkness had been Remy's home. Most likely, her home was now destroyed, and Remy herself essentially homeless.</p>

<p>Wilbert wanted to tell Remy everything would be okay, but in all honesty, Wilbert had no idea whether or not anything was going to be okay. Fortunately, he could say at least one thing to make her feel better.</p>

<p>"I'm sorry about your home Remy," said Wilbert. "Don't worry about it though, because you can stay here with me. This can be your new home."</p>

<p>Again, Remy didn't understand, but she could feel the sympathy coming from Wilbert, and it did comfort her.</p>

<p>Just as they had in the spaceship before, the two of them sat there together recovering.</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>While resting, Wilbert took some time to collect his thoughts and solidify his intentions. He needed to have a clear understanding of what his situation was.</p>

<p>After a few moments reorganizing his thoughts, Wilbert was able to assemble a clear recollection of everything that had happened inside the spaceship. What really stood out to him was how terrifying and dangerous the last moments had been. It seemed a miracle Remy had been able to save them at all.</p>

<p>Since the glow of the blanket was still pretty dim, Wilbert stood up and went to get another flashlight. Once he found one, he walked back towards the ship to look at it more closely. Remy followed along with him.</p>

<p>Wilbert suspected that returning to the inside of the ship would be terribly unsafe. It didn't make any difference though, because Wilbert couldn't imagine how he'd get back inside the spaceship anyway. The window on its side was now completely gone.</p>

<p>Together, the two of them walked around the spaceship several times, observing it from all sides.  Remy, a few steps behind, ended up facing the side of the ship, with Wilbert at its front. Neither of them could find much of any interest. There was only solid hull, no windows, doorways, or anything else. The spaceship looked much like it had before Remy's arrival. Still, Remy decided she would try to get in anyway. She jumped up and poked her head into the ship. The result was a very peculiar sight.</p>

<p>Wilbert was suddenly able to see Remy on both sides of the ship, as if she were split in two pieces. Her body was leaning into the port side of the ship as her head poked out of starboard.</p>

<p>Remy looked like she was in two disconnected pieces. She appeared as a little floating head peeking out from the other side of the spaceship, while her body stayed her body stayed in place.</p>

<p>Remy withdrew her head. Immediately she was whole again, right back where she started. Then she returned to Wilbert.</p>

<p>Wilbert was quite perplexed by what he saw. At the same time, he was less frustrated than he had been before. His situation was different now. He was still locked out of the spaceship but progress seemed possible. Wilbert was developing a plan.</p>

<p>He didn't know precisely what he was supposed to do, but he had at least a general idea of his task. He remembered BBR's request, and he still had hope that if he could complete his task, he might be able to repair his ship, or rather, repair <em>the</em> ship (Burt). If Wilbert could help BBR then she'd help him, and he could build a new spaceship BBR would teach him to build a new spaceship of his own, one that really would be “Property of Wilbert”.</p>

<p>Wilbert was ready to take his next steps. "Okay," he thought, "Mission objectives:  Water...  blanket... spaceship...  Get the water to the blanket, get the blanket to the spaceship."</p>

<p>It was the most he could understand, given the few directions he’d gotten from BBR.</p>

<p>How exactly the blanket would help Wilbert to get water was the part Wilbert didn't understand. BBR had mentioned she'd done something to the blanket in order to make it useful, but Wilbert didn't know what. He did at least understand what solution he was looking for. He needed to figure out what was so special about that blanket.</p>

<p>Wilbert walked back towards where he had woken up. Remy’s blanket sat there where she’d left it, between the ship and his work desk. Wilbert knelt down on one knee and picked it up, then shook it a bit to uncrumple it.</p>

<p>In addition to its obvious glow, Wilbert noticed how soft and smooth it was. As it uncrumpled, he could also tell that it had a circular shape, almost like a round bath mat. It was surprisingly large once it was splayed out.</p>

<p>Although it felt about as heavy as a normal blanket should've been, Wilbert noticed that the fabric itself seemed to be silky and thin. It was hard to tell just how thin, because there was a thicker rim around the blanket, where the fabric was rolled up. That rim was tight but somehow still very soft. It ran all the way around the blanket's circumference, so Wilbert couldn't actually see any edge of the fabric. It was hard to tell exactly how thick or thin the blanket was.</p>

<p>Though Wilbert couldn't find any stitching, he saw many tight folds and seams all over the surface of the blanket, like the seams on the outside of sweater. There was even a seam running all the way around the outer edge of the rim.</p>

<p>Wilbert was struggling to make sense of it. So far this blanket wasn't seeming like a very effective water transportation mechanism, but then it occurred to Wilbert that there was another side to the blanket he hadn't yet given much attention.</p>

<p>Wilbert turned the blanket around and laid it on the dusty wooden floor in front of him. What he found was curious. This new side felt more like fine velvet than silk, but more importantly, there were little buttons all over its surface. Most of them looked like tiny donuts but with holes so narrow that Wilbert couldn't tell if they were actually holes at all, or just dimples.</p>

<p>Wilbert attempted to grab one of the buttons, but it immediately felt strange. As if it resisted his touch. He was able to touch it, hold it, and feel the surface, but it felt a little like pushing two north ends of magnets together.</p>

<p>Wilbert wondered about the other buttons, so he tried feeling more of the buttons with his fingers. He felt their various shapes and pushed, and poked at every one he could find.</p>

<p>Eventually one of them reacted quite differently than the rest. It opened just slightly when he poked at it. So, Wilbert pushed on that one again with just the tip of his finger, and found a fairly interesting response.</p>

<p>The button seemed to grow. Not only did the button grow, but the depression in the centre of it actually expanded as he pushed his finger into it just slightly.</p>

<p>Wilbert was shocked and surprised. The whole button seemed to grab at his fingertip. It felt very much like sticking a finger into the nozzle of a vacuum cleaner. He quickly pulled his entire arm back away from the button and looked at his finger tip.</p>

<p>Wilbert's fingertip was swollen red and the skin looked like it was about to burst. Wilbert was very glad he hadn't tried to look at the button up close with his eye.</p>

<p>Something else was also quite obvious. Even after retracting his finger, Wilbert continued to hear a hissing sound very much like the sound of a vacuum cleaner or a drinking straw. The sound was coming from that same button, which was now a tiny hole pulling air into itself.</p>

<p>"Crazy!" said Wilbert, muttering to himself.</p>

<p>As Wilbert listened to the suction, it gradually calmed down until he could hear it no more. The button closed up and the suction stopped.</p>

<p>The button, was no longer a hole anymore, it was again just a button, as it had been before Wilbert found it.</p>

<p>Kneeling on the floor with the blanket was pretty awkward, so Wilbert carried it over to one of his larger tool benches, and climbed onto a tall stool beside the bench. Such a tall stool was useful, because Wilbert himself was so short, and the stool was one of many items that in the barn that allowed him to make use of places he couldn't otherwise reach.</p>

<p>Remy hopped up beside him onto the workbench, standing right beside the blanket and looking down at it.</p>

<p>Wilbert wanted to experiment further on the blanket, but didn't want to hurt his finger again. Instead, he looked around at the various tools that were available near his workbench. He decided that a flathead   screwdriver with a rounded handle at the back was probably his best bet for opening the button again.</p>

<p>Wilbert grabbed a screwdriver and returned to the blanket. Carefully, reaching down he poked at the button with the flathead tip of the screw driver.</p>

<p>As Wilbert pressed into it he was able to make the button open up, and as he tried harder, the button became a larger and larger ring. Again, a hissing sound could be heard as the suction began.</p>

<p>Leaning back, and gripping the screwdriver tightly, Wilbert attempted to pry at the inner edge of the button's ring, to open it wider. Sure enough, it did expand, and the suction, which had briefly calmed down a little, gradually picked back up again.</p>

<p>Wilbert drew the screwdriver away. Slowly the ring contracted back to a button, and the suction subsided. After a few seconds, the button was back to its original size, and the hole was effectively closed.</p>

<p>The button had seemed to become looser, easier to pry open, so in a fairly careless action, Wilbert decided to use the rounded back end of the screwdriver to push the button open.</p>

<p>It was a bad idea. The button opened right back up into a ring, and Wilbert immediately lost his grip on the screwdriver. It slipped out of his hands and was pulled violently into the vacuum through the ring.</p>

<p>Wilbert was startled, but continued looking into the hole, trying to spot his screwdriver.  He wasn't able to though, and he couldn't even watch for long, because within a couple of seconds, the hole closed back up again. The screwdriver was gone, and Wilbert felt foolish.</p>

<p>Not wanting to give up, Wilbert grabbed some pliers and used them to open the button back up.  He tried to spot the screwdriver inside, but all he could see was what appeared to be a black void. It was just like the window he'd found on the side of the spaceship. It was nothing Wilbert could make any sense of.</p>

<p>He decided to take another look at the back of the blanket. Wilbert picked up the blanket and turned it around to look at the other side. It was still quite plain. There were no buttons and no screwdriver anywhere to be found. Somehow the screwdriver was lost inside the blanket.</p>

<p>"I'm going to need another screwdriver!" Wilbert joked as he looked towards Remy.</p>

<p>Wilbert didn't immediately get a screwdriver though. Instead he just sat looking at the button which was now closed again.</p>

<p>It occurred to Wilbert that if the blanket could suck in air, and could suck in screwdrivers, then it could probably suck in other things too.</p>

<p>Most importantly, the blanket could almost certainly suck in water. After all, water was what BBR had requested. Her intentions for Wilbert and the blanket were starting to make sense.</p>

<p>It also occurred to Wilbert that the empty space inside the blanket looked a lot like the empty space inside the space ship. If the blackness of the blanket looked like the inside of the ship, then perhaps it represented a way to get water back to BBR.</p>

<p>"Okay Remy," said Wilbert, "I think I know what's going on here."</p>

<p>It all seemed pretty clear to Wilbert. If Wilbert was to act as a delivery man, this blanket was effectively Wilbert's delivery truck.</p>

<p>The details that still really puzzled Wilbert were all the other buttons on the blanket. What were they for?</p>

<p>He tried pushing at them again, but nothing much happened in response. Those other buttons were either purely decorative or simply not functional at the moment.</p>

<p>Wilbert decided that for the time being, understanding the other buttons wasn't important. What was important was filling the blanket with water.</p>

<p>He was going to need to test it, to be sure it would work.</p>

<p>Wilbert picked up the blanket and walked to the corner of the barn, which was the only part of the barn that was divided from the main open space. It had a room that had once been a small office, along with one other smaller room, the washroom.</p>

<p>Wilbert didn't spend much time in this office, aside from using the refrigerator and the sink. Now though, the sink, and the running water from its faucets, was exactly what Wilbert needed.</p>

<p>Wilbert bundled up the blanket and carried it over to the sink. Remy followed. He then stood up on a step ladder beside the sink.  Remy hopped up onto the counter to watch.</p>

<p>Putting the blanket down under the faucet, and beginning to run the water, Wilbert wasn't sure what to expect. He hadn't yet opened the button. This was on purpose though as he was curious how the fabric of the blanket would react to water. Wilbert also wondered whether or not the button would open on its own when hit by water.</p>

<p>It did not. Water just bounced off of the button and splashed all around the sink, wetting the blanket. Wilbert turned off the faucet before too much of that splashing hit him.</p>

<p>It wasn't until Wilbert picked the blanket back up that he noticed anything interesting.</p>

<p>As he lifted the blanket, he noticed that the part he lifted already seemed quite dry. Almost all the water had dripped away quickly, and what remained was dripping off of the blanket in a hurry.</p>

<p>Wilbert turned around with the blanket in hand, and gave the blanket a good shake as he splayed it out, flapping it briefly. What little water remained was quickly cast aside onto the floor. After that, as far as Wilbert could tell, the blanket had dried out completely.</p>

<p>This seemed odd to Wilbert because it wasn't as though the blanket were a tarp or a raincoat. Even a plastic bag would still have droplets of water left over on its surface after being shaken.</p>

<p>In addition, although most of it was smooth like silk, one side did have a slight velvety texture.</p>

<p>There were also many folds and wrinkles for water to normally get stuck in. When Wilbert stuck his fingers into the various folds of the blanket, it was obvious they were dry as well. The blanket had squeezed every last bit of water out of it itself.</p>

<p>As Wilbert looked over the blanket, it also occurred to him that it should have been quite dirty from sitting on the floor earlier. The floor was made of wood, but there was plenty of dust and dirt all over it. Wilbert did not do a lot of cleaning. The blanket should have picked up some of that dust and dirt.</p>

<p>Instead, Wilbert could see that on the blanket, dirt was now just as absent as water. Instead of being a mess, the blanket was clean and looked sparkling new, much like Burt's hull.</p>

<p>Despite being quite impressed, Wilbert put the blanket back into the sink so that he could refocus on the task at hand. He made sure the mysterious opening button was positioned directly under the faucet, face up, at the top of the scrunched up blanket.</p>

<p>With his fingernails, Willbert pushed into the button and pryed it open. It was slow but took less force than he expected. Even with just his fingernails, within a few seconds, he was able to ooen the button to about the width of a dime. Wilbert was satisfied that would be enough for his experiment.</p>

<p>Without delay, Wilbert moved his hand to the faucet and began running the water again. A thick stream of water started pouring onto the blanket and its button, and Wilbert quickly adjusted the blanket making sure the button stayed under the flow of water.</p>

<p>At first, water splashed everywhere, since there was too much water to fit through the tiny hole in the button. As Wilbert watched though, the donut ring shape of the button widened. Before long the button looked more like a large hooped earring, significantly wider than the stream of water pouring into it. The splashing stopped, and the water became a steady stream which simply disappeared into the black void behind the button's opening.</p>

<p>Finally, the button stabalized and corrected itself, by slowly shrinking back down until it was just a tiny bit wider than the stream of water pouring into it.</p>

<p>And there it was, the solution that Wilbert sought, how to get water into the blanket.</p>

<p>Wilbert smiled. He may have been worn out, tired, sore, and fighting a headache, but Wilbert smiled anyway. He smiled because he believed the completion of his quest was now just a matter of scale. Wilbert's only immediate question was which body of water he would go to first.</p>
