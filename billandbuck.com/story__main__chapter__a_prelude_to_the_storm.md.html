<h1>Chapter 4 <br> A Prelude To The Storm</h1>

<p><br></p>

<p>"It was a dark and stormy night..."</p>

<p>...Really, it wasn't quite dark yet, which meant it wasn't actually night, nor was the wind yet worthy of being called a storm. Still, Wilbert could see the signs incoming, and Wilbert's mind couldn't help but think of those omnious words. It was clearly <em>becoming</em> dark, and <em>becoming</em> stormy. Wilbert had <em>always</em> been afraid of storms. That night, he expected a bad one.</p>

<p>All of this made Wilbert uneasy. Sitting in the upper level of his barn, he looked out through its windows. All the plants and trees were swaying. As he watched, through his body ran an eerie feeling, a presence of <em>power</em>. He noticed a sense of energy running through the air, and he pictured it sparkling throughout the tall grass swaying in the wind.</p>

<p>The wind was building to a howl, but since it wasn't so just yet, Wilbert decided he should try to stop worrying. To take his mind off the weather, Wilbert shifted his attention by turning to look over to his indoor surroundings. Peering down on his workshop, he looked at the empty space where he should have seen his spaceship, but there, at that moment, his ship didn't appear to be present.</p>

<p>It was an October evening, and it was several days after Wilbert had moved his spaceship into his barn. Since then, things had not been going well for Wilbert.</p>

<p>Wilbert was dealing with very two different problems, and both of these problems were extraordinarily irritating.</p>

<p>First there was the problem of his spaceship's variable presence.  Just like in the field before, his spaceship occasionally disappeared, going missing from his barn.</p>

<p>It was very unclear to Wilbert why or how the spaceship kept disappearing. Whatever the spaceship did when it "disappeared", Wilbert had never actually caught it happening. His ignorance was mostly the result of unlucky timing, because he couldn't <em>always</em> keep his eyes on the ship.</p>

<p>Fortunately though, Wilbert's concern over these disappearances was minor. It wasn't much of a problem, because just as before, when it disappeared in the field, the spaceship always seemed to come back again. So far, all of its disappearances had been fairly short lived.</p>

<p>The other problem Wilbert faced was the more serious concern. The reason it was so serious and frustrating was because it locked Wilbert in a sort of standstill. It blocked all the plans was making for his spaceship.</p>

<p>When he first captured the ship, Wilbert had been so excited and filled with hope. He even had pride in what he’d accomplished. After all, not just any kid could bring home a spaceship.</p>

<p>Now though, Wilbert’s pride was gradually being humbled. As hard as he tried, he just couldn’t do anything useful with his spaceship.</p>

<p>Wilbert had poked and prodded at it for days.  He’d tried so many methods, hoping to get inside of his newly aquired spaceship. His attempts had been intelligently varied. The tools he'd tried had included a crowbar, a drill, and even a sledgehammer.  The ship's hull withstood them all, and every part of the ship had been equally resillient.  Wilbert had approached it from every angle, attacking the top, the sides and the bottom.</p>

<p>Still, nothing he had tried was working. In fact, nothing seemed to have any effect at all.  Even after all the beating it took, the ship looked absolutely, totally perfect. It had not even the slightest hint of a scratch anywhere on it. It remained exactly as if it had never been touched. The ship’s shiny green surface seemed invincible.</p>

<p>In response Wilbert had escalated to using some of the more "industrial strength" solutions he had laying about his farm. Though he wasn't actually allowed to play with many of the more dangerous items on the farm, he'd gone ahead and tried some of them anyway, since nobody seemed to be watching.</p>

<p>All had been useless. Even his most extreme methods had resulted in nothing but failure. As far as Wilbert could tell, his ship was impervious to any attack.  Its shimmering hull withstood even the crushing force of a driving tractor, as well as more exotic forces such as those from chemicals, fire, or electricity. Wilbert was running out of options, and he was really begining to believe that nothing would work.</p>

<p>So, on the evening of the storm, Wilbert was feeling pretty dejected. He was also feeling more and more frightened, worried over how his barn would hold against the intensifying winds.</p>

<p>Wilbert's concerns were misplaced, because really, that old barn would've stood up to practically anything. Much more worthy of his attention would have been the strange events going on inside the spaceship. Those were significantly more outlandish than mere weather.</p>

<p>A sort of awakening was slowly taking place in the spaceship, but Wilbert remained oblivious to it.</p>

<p>Wilbert decended from the barn's upper level, down to the ship's usual parking space in the middle of the floor. He paced around, stomped his feet, and shock his head.</p>

<p><em>The</em> spaceship was seeming less and less like <em>his</em> spaceship, since he couldn't get into it or even keep track of where it was.</p>

<p>It also seemed a little less like <em>his</em> spaceship, because its sticker of ownership, had completely fallen off. His spaceship no longer read "property of Wilbert", though it was unclear when or where the sticker had fallen off. Wilbert wondered how it fell off, why it did so, and where it had gone.</p>

<p>Wilbert imagined that if he found the sticker, it might provide some kind of a clue. Perhaps it could be a sort of breacrumb on the ship's trail. Maybe, studying that sticker could reveal what had happened to it. Maybe that sticker could help Wilbert understand what was going on.</p>

<p>That entire train of thought seemed like a long shot, but it was the best idea Wilbert had thought of in a while. In fact, it was pretty much his <em>only</em> idea.</p>

<p>So, Wilbert decided to look for the sticker, and he started by looking over the barn's floor.</p>

<p>Most of the floor was a rugged assembly of wooden boards, all nailed together. Wilbert scanned over those boards, and although he was looking for the sticker, he also began to consider the floor itself.</p>

<p>The barn was old and its floor was imperfect. It was solid and well-built, but it was also very old. Wilbert noticed that between the boards in the flooring, there were many gaps. Most were full of dirt and grime, but a few openings did remain. The sight of those gaps sprung another idea into his mind. Wilbert realized that there was in fact one tricky place the sticker could have been hiding. It could have fallen <em>between</em> the gaps and <em>into</em> the floor.</p>

<p>Wilbert thought about all the other gaps all over the floor, and remembered an obvious one right in the middle. It was close to where he'd first parked the ship.</p>

<p>Intently, Wilbert rushed to the middle of the barn, and found that gap in the boards.  He dropped down to his hands and knees, and lowered his face towards the ground. Then he peered into the gap between the boards. Could he find the sticker?</p>

<p>Nope... there was no sticker he could see. However, as Wilbert knelt there on the floor, with his eyes so close to the ground, he was able to see small details on the floor...</p>

<p>One of those details seemed so impossible, Wilbert could barely believe it.</p>

<p>Right there, just under his face, against the floorboards, was his spaceship. It was so tiny that Wilbert couldn't even be sure of what he was seeing at first. He doubted that it could possibly be his spaceship, but as he moved his head around, viewing from all sides, he decided that it was unmistakable. This really was his spaceship, it was just small... very very small.</p>

<p>All of the disappearances now suddenly made sense. Wilbert understood, just then, that his spaceship had never actually gone anywhere. His spaceship had been in his barn the whole time.</p>

<p>Wilbert was having a hard time believing the ship could be so small, but within a few moments he accepted this truth. All things considered, having a spaceship in his barn was already ridiculously strange. A ship that was sometimes tiny didn't make the situation that much stranger.</p>

<p>Wilbert reached out with his fingertip and nudged the tiny ship. As usual, it moved easily at first, but then held firmer, and then slowly recoiled back to where it had been.</p>

<p>Briefly, Wilbert was overjoyed. He now understood why his spaceship sometimes seemed to disappear. Before long though, Wilbert was back to agonizing over why he couldn't get inside of his spaceship. He was also irritated because as long as his ship was so tiny, getting in was probably going to be even more impossible.</p>

<p>Wilbert figured that if he just waited a little while, the ship would probably return back to its normal size, just as it had before. Then perhaps he could go back to breaking his way inside.</p>

<p>So, Wilbert waited. Since, at this point, he was merely waiting for his spaceship to return the size, Wilbert decided he could have a bite to eat.</p>

<p>Although barns don't normally have much in the way of kitchens, Wilbert was fortunate because his aunt had left the barn overflowing with useful equipment. One of those pieces of equipment was an old refrigerator. Although it looked old as the ages, his refrigerator still kept as cold as ever, so Wilbert stocked it with bits of food he'd smuggled out of his parents' house. (As long as he didn't touch the beer, they didn't really seem to mind.)</p>

<p>Wilbert took a jar of peanut butter out of his refrigerator, grabbed a knife, and pulled a few crackers out of an old tin on the counter. (A tin Wilbert used to keep the local mice out of his snacks.) Then he walked over to the main desk of the workshop, and sat down on his favorite seat, a swiveling stool where he usually worked. He rolled his stool a little to the side and found an empty place on the desk to put down the plate, between the piles of papers covering the desktop.</p>

<p>As he assembled the food, Wilbert glanced over many of the papers on his desk. Drawings of the spaceship dominated what was currently on display. In the few days since he'd found his spaceship, Wilbert had come up with more ideas for it than most kids would have had in a lifetime. Sadly, all these ideas really only added to his frustration, because being locked out of his ship meant that he couldn't pursue any of his incredible ideas.</p>

<p>Occasionally, Wilbert looked back at his ship while he was eating. It was only about 10 feet behind him. The first few times he looked back, he saw nothing of interest, but before he'd finished his crackers, he heard a loud thump, and turned to see his the spaceship back to a reasonable size again.</p>

<p>As Wilbert thought about the size of his spaceship, he decided that every time he had seen it, its size had probably been a little bit different. He hadn't noticed earlier, but he felt confident in retrospect. Sometimes it was slightly bigger, and sometimes it was slightly smaller, but never so much as to be terribly obvious. The difference in size was only obvious when the ship disappeared completely. Other than that it was usually around the size of a motorcycle.</p>

<p>After thinking a little further, Wilbert shook his head and conceded that these observations were tenuous at best. He hadn't observed the ship for very long, so he had no way of being sure any of this stay the same going forward. Perhaps, he wondered, the only thing consistent about the size of the ship was its inconsistency.</p>

<p>In reality, the ship tended to have good reasons for why it became any given size. Its size at the moment was soon going to be useful to what was awakening inside.</p>

<p>As he thought about its growing and shrinking, Wilbert looked upon the ship, and imagined all the exciting things he could do with it. Before long though, his excitement gave way to impatience, and then to frustration. He wondered if anything was ever going to work out. Anything, he wished, that would finally help him break into his spaceship.</p>

<p>As luck would have it, such an event did in fact soon happen. Almost as if the ship was aware of and responding to Wilbert's wishes. However, although there <em>was</em> a response, it <em>wasn't</em> to Wilbert's wishes, and it <em>wasn't</em> exactly the ship that was responding.</p>

<p>An energy built up slowly. Wilbert started to take notice only because, a new sound was taking over, overpowering the wind outside.  At first, the sound was interesting and exciting to Wilbert, but before long, the ship was buzzing and screeching so loudly that it hurt Wilbert's ears.</p>

<p>Wilbert covered his ears and grimaced, overjoyed and terrified all at the same time. He turned his head away, trying to find some relief from the noise.</p>

<p>The screeches finally peaked, and the ship shook violently. There was a thunderous crack, and sudden implosion. Suction reached out from the ship and pulled at everything around it.</p>

<p>The screeching stopped, but in its place the blasting sound of swirling air became overwhelming. Twisting out from the side of the spaceship, a momentary tornado had taken shape in Wilbert's workshop. By comparison, the developing storm outside seemed to be nothing at all.</p>

<p>Shocked and panicked, Wilbert resisted and curled himself into a tuck, knees to his face and arms around his head. He protected his face and his eyes from the sandy dirt that was flying around everywhere.</p>

<p>Then, in no time at all, and as quickly as it had started, the tornado was gone. The remains of the turbulence dissipated, and what followed were hundreds of little sounds. All the collected junk in the workshop had been rattled. Pieces fell over, and a number of items even shattered. Finally, as all else settled, the sound of crinkling paper took over. So many of Wilbert's notes and drawings had been tossed up from his desk and into the air. They fluttered downwards in spirals, falling and landing all over the barn.</p>

<p>Everything settled and quieted, and the howling wind outside became obvious again. Wilbert opened his eyes and uncurled his body. Then he cautiously peeked back towards his spaceship.</p>

<p>As terrified as Wilbert was in that moment, he was also at least a little excited. The fact that the ship had done anything at all was thrilling, and it gave Wilbert reason to hope. Perhaps some change had occured, and perhaps such a change could get him past the impenetrable hull and into the ship. The corners of Wilbert's mind dreamed of finding whatever wonders awaited.</p>

<p>Optimistically, Wilbert approached the ship. At first he found it to be the same as before. Luckily though, when he walked around to the west side of the ship, he was overjoyed to see that there was in fact a new and striking difference.</p>

<p>A separation in the panels had formed, and that separation was growing. What appeared was small at first, perhaps only the size of Wilbert's head, but the opening continued to grow. Gradually, between the panels, the lines which had been so thin earlier were expanding into a large and circular hole.</p>

<p>Wilbert looked on excitedly, expecting to see something inside the circle. Instead, he was shocked to find that he could see nothing at all.</p>

<p>The circular gap between the panels, was becoming a void of blackness, the likes of which Wilbert had never seen.</p>

<p>This new shape was more than just a darkness. It was a kind of perfect emptiness. Nothing whatsoever could be seen between the panels. The entire area was completely devoid of any light.  It was an emptiness that was darker than dark, and it looked as though it were an opening into an infinite expanse of space, an exspance containing nothing at all.</p>

<p>Wilbert stood in front of this void and marvelled in disbelief.  Since it appeared to be a hole, he thought that he would be able to reach into it, and with the utmost of caution, he slowly raised his hand and pointed a finger towards the void. Slowly, he inched his finger forward, but then, just as he reached the gap, he bumped the tip of his finger aginst what felt like a solid surface.  Rather than an empty void, what he felt was every bit as solid as the shiny hull before.</p>

<p>"Noooooo... "  Wilbert whined as he frantically ran his fingers all across the darkened section.</p>

<p>The only thing his fingers felt was more of the same. He could feel not one bit of difference between the shiny green metal, and this new void-like area. It was all just perfectly smooth, and sadly, it was perfectly impervious as well.</p>

<p>Wilbert was devastated. He had wished for a sort of doorway, but what appeared was at best a window. Worse yet, it was about as useless as any window could be, since nothing could be seen on the other side.</p>

<p>Fingers clenched, Wilbert slammed the base of his fists into the ship's hull.  Once again, his hopes of getting into the spaceship were fading quickly.</p>

<p>There <em>had</em> to be something inside didn't there?  Could the ship have really been completely empty?</p>

<p>Eventually a very complicated answer would emerge from that question. The answer was in a sense, yes, but also in a sense, no. Whether or not the spaceship had an actual inside was a question that couldn't be answered in any conventional sense. What Wilbert didn't yet understand was that the ship had no single-point at its center. Halfway between both sides of the ship, was really nowhere at all. That region of space simply didn't exist.</p>

<p>However, if the word "inside" refered to the place holding what the ship carried, rather than simply the place between its walls, then it was true that the inside of that ship was more than Wilbert ever could have imagined.</p>
