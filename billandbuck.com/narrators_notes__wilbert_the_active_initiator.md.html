<h1>Narator's Notes - About Wilbert As The Initiator</h1>

<p>Wilbert was a loser boy whose parents hated him. At least, that's what he thought anyway.</p>

<p>The reality was much more complicated. For example, his parents didn't really hate him, it was just that they didn't pay much attention to him either.</p>

<p>The end result, one way or another, was that Wilbert felt pretty bad about himself. Those feelings resulted in some pretty terrible behaviour, which led to the events of this story.</p>

<p>You see, as much as Bert was the enabler and the catalyst of our story, Wilbert was the active initiator. Wilbert was the one who deliberately took the actions that he did. Everything else just spiraled out from there on. Ultimately, what Wilbert set in motion, determined the fate of the universe itself. </p>

<p>All of this because, since he didn't have a single friend in the world, he decided he would start making them.</p>

<p>How could a small child, still in elementary school, have such a profound effect on the universe?</p>

<p>Well, the answer, is that Wilbert found Bert in that field... and that's where the events of our story continue...</p>
