"Wilbert was a loser boy whose parents hated him."
<br><br>
At least, that's what he thought, and it's how the song goes.
<br><br>
The reality was much more complicated. For example, his parents didn't
really hate him, it was just that they didn't pay much attention to
him either.
<br><br>
The end result, one way or another, was that Wilbert felt pretty bad
about himself. Eventually, as they often do, these strong negative feelings 
led to Wilbert engaging in some pretty terrible behaviour.  The results of which were very much his own responsibility.
<br><br>
For as much as Burt was the enabler and the catalyst of our story, Wilbert
was the active initiator. Wilbert was the one who deliberately took
the actions that he did. Everything else just spiraled out of control
from there on...  ultimately determining the very fate of the
universe itself.
<br><br>
All of this because, "...since he didn't have a single friend in the
world, he decided he would start making them."

People may wonder: How could one small child, still in elementary school, have such a profound effect on the universe?</p>

<p>The answer, of course, is that Wilbert found Burt in that field,
and that's where the events of our story continue...</p>
