<h1>Intermission - Wilbert's Workshop</h1>

<p>By signs and stickers, Wilbert's workshop was clearly labeled as his own. So were many of the contents within. Wilbert made sure there was no confusion as to who owned any of it.</p>

<p>Wilbert's workshop was his favorite place to be. His aunt Rose, long ago, had renovated and repurposed the oldest standing barn on her land, turning it into a place to pursue her many projects.</p>

<p>Many of Wilbert's happiest memories were of him and Rose together, inside the workshop.  Rose had been like a mother to him, more so than his real mother who'd generally neglected him. In fact, Rose had probably been the one real positive influence on Wilbert's life.</p>

<p>Most of Wilbert's fondest memories were of his time with Rose in the barn. He had learned so much from Rose. He'd followed her work on so many projects and experiments.</p>

<p>So, when Rose passed away, Wilbert effectively inherited the barn and workshop inside. Around the same time, along with him, his parents also moved into the farmhouse nearby.</p>

<p>That farmhouse was where they stayed. His parents had never even made the trek from the farmhouse to the workshop. Not that it was that terribly far. Rather, his parents ignored the barn for the same reason they ignored the rest of the farm. They simply couldn't be bothered to deal with it. They were usually too inebriated to care. Instead they were content to waste away Rose's money from the comforts of the farmhouse.</p>

<p>So in a practical sense, Wilbert's workshop and the entire barn, were now his and his alone.</p>

<p>The barn was very old, but it had been built sturdy and was meant to last. It was nothing like the other modern buildings on the farm, most of which were newer additions, for production of the "Rivers and Roses" brand of food. Those buildings were generally less than a decade old, whereas the barn holding Wilbert's workshop was older than Rose herself ever was.</p>

<p>Even though the barn was old, it had been significantly renovated. Rose had fixed it up and added utilities such as power and water. There had been windows put in and Rose had added a washroom and an office, which Wilbert used as a makeshift kitchen. Those were the only real separate rooms in the barn. The rest was an open floorplan, including a loft, a storage area, and finally, the most important place of all, the workshop. It was the part of the barn that featured the workbench, tables, desks, and the vast variety of tools surrounding them.</p>

<p>The workshop had been the heart and soul of the farm for many years, because the workshop was where Rose poured her own heart and soul into her projects. Rose's experiments there even included her custom flavorings for desserts, which were really what enabled the farm's great success. Many of her designs from the workshop had led to greater efficiencies on her farm as well, since Rose's interests went well beyond food. Her love of mechanics and lectronics were on full display in that workshop.</p>

<p>When Wilbert inherited the barn, he inherited all of those contents within.</p>

<p>There was so much in the way of tools, equipment, and machinery that Wilbert hadn't even taken stock of it all. He had taken advantage of many items, but within the piles and piles of junk, there was even more yet to be discovered. Depending on one's definition of the word, it wasn't necessarily "junk" either. Calling it junk wasn't really fair because most of it was still perfectly functional.</p>

<p>There was even more junk outside. Rose had been a hoarder, and Wilbert had inherited the hoard. Wilbert wouldn't have had it any other way though. The combination of the barn, the junk, and workshop was perfect for him. Inheriting it had been the silver lining around Rose's tragic death.</p>

<p>Rose's spirit of ingenuity lived on through Wilbert in his workshop. It was that same ingenuity which was destined to spiral out of control. After Burt's arrival, it was only a matter of time before the workshop, and Wilbert's creations, would transcend human civilization.</p>
