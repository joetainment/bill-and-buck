Chapter 7 - Who's That Girl
======================
<br>


Wilbert was in utter disbelief.

The visitor, now a fluffy little ball, had rolled right through the wall. It didn't break through the wall though.  It wasn't like there was a hole in the wall.  Nope... the wall was perfectly intact.  The visitor had just passed right through it, as if it wasn't even there.

It was almost like this visitor was a ghost, except that Wilbert was pretty sure it wasn't.

Before thinking about it for too long though, Wilbert started to worry. He worried because he really didn't want to lose his only link to the inside of his spaceship.

Wilbert called out to his visitor,  "Come back!  ... Please don't go."

Wilbert heard no response.

Of course, the silence wasn't surprising. Wilbert was already pretty sure that the visitor didn't speak, so Wilbert didn't actually expect a response.

Luckily, it immediately became obvious that the visitor hadn't gone very far.  New sounds could be heard outside.

Crash! Clink, clank.


Apparently the visitor was now rummaging through the storage outside of the barn, just as it had done inside.

Wilbert couldn't see through the wall, so he couldn't yet see exactly what was going on. However, he knew the wall had windows upstairs in the loft, so he could look through those, instead of going out into the storm.

Wilbert moved quickly, running up the stairs that escalated over the cat's corner. When he got to the top of the stairs, he ran to the window, and reached for the handle.

Wilbert hesitated to pull the handle at first, because the storm was still raging outside. All the distractions had taken his attention away from his fear of the storm, but now he was confronted with it directly. Opening this handle meant the storm was going to be right in his face.

Wilbert took a deep breath and lifted the handle. The window opened up, and as the opening widened, heavy rain blasted into his face, the wind blew his hair back, and Wilbert's ears were filled with roaring sounds.

All of those scary sounds were so much louder now that the window was open.

Wilbert tried to ignore all that, and he shined his flashlight down, searching the ground until he found his little visitor. The visitor was pretty easy to spot actually.  Orange and purple colors stood out strongly from the grays and browns of the dirt.

The ball was rolling around all over, bashing stuff around. Eventually it rolled into a large crate, and the sounds that followed were ear piercing.

Screeching, growling, yowling, and hissing... 

Wilbert was pretty sure he recognized these sounds. The sounds he was listening to were made by raccoons.

Wilbert was used to raccoons.  Although there were no raccoons on the inside of his barn, they were regular residents of its surroundings. All the boxes, crates, and trailers outside of the barn made for ideal raccoon dwellings. Wilbert had known for a while that raccoons were making  homes in the storage outside.

Sometimes the raccoons fought, either with each other, or with other animals. Although sometimes those fights were loud, Wilbert had never heard the raccoons get this angry. 

Then, with a burst of speed, a trio of raccoons lept out from the side of the crate.  There was more screeching and hissing, and then another raccoon ran out, faster than Wilbert had ever seen any raccoon run anywhere.

For a minute it was quiet, but Wilbert stayed laser focused on the crate. Another minute passed, and what followed was the exit of one last raccoon.

This raccoon was not like the others though.  In fact, this raccoon wasn't even really a raccoon.

This new raccoon was furry and stretchy, and moved around in a way that didn't seem like any ordinary raccoon. Most importantly to Wilbert, a considerable amount of this raccoon's fur was orange and purple.

This colorful raccoon was actually Wilbert's visitor.

Wilbert stood watching his visitor, the colorful new raccoon, who seemed much more relaxed now. It wasn't moving about frantically anymore. It didn't seem to be searching for anything any longer. It just strutted about outside, clearly not bothered by the rain or the wind. Then, after a few moments, the new raccoon walked back toward the barn.

As it approached the barn's wall, Wilbert lost sight of it from the window. Quickly, he turned his head to look down the stairs, and then watched, as his visitor walked back through the wall, into the barn. 

Wilbert ran down the stairs, and for a moment, he worried that his quick movements might scare the visitor... but they didn't.

Instead of being scared, his visitor (the new raccoon) stood proudly at the bottom of the stairs. As Wilbert got close, the raccoon faced him. Then it slowly did a little turn, as if to demonstrate its new form to Wilbert.

The new raccoon was showing off.

Wilbert shook his head, and chucked.  After all the frightening events of the night, this new development really lightened the mood.  Wilbert's visitor looked more comical than dangerous. Really, this colorful raccoon was about the least threatening space alien Wilbert could have imagined.

The raccoon did another little strut, walking back and forth, showing off a little more, and then walked right up to Wilbert and rubbed the side of its body against Wilbert's leg. It may have been a raccoon, but its behavior was much more like that of a typical cat's.

"Hmmm…  solid after all…"  thought Wilbert, "Definitely not a ghost."

Wilbert knelt down to take a closer look at the new raccoon.

It was adorable. In many ways it looked almost like a cartoon character, including its very expressive facial expressions. All in all, its appearance was a strange blend between a plush cartoon cat and a raccoon.

Wilbert noticed the pinkish lips of the raccoon, the colorful claws (or fingernails), and the long eyelashes. All of which were very similar to "Ms. Kitty", the plush cat. Like that toy, this new raccoon looked distinctly feminine.

Wilbert knelt down close to the new raccoon.

"Who's that girl?"  he asked, with a little grin.

He waited for a moment, but of course he got no response. His visitor didn't speak.

Wilbert didn't need a response though. It had been a rhetorical question anyway.

"Well, since you don't talk, I guess I can't ask you your name." Wilbert said before a short wait. "I'm going to have to name you myself."

Wilbert paused again to consider a name, and after a moment, he thought about one of his favorite names. He decided to go with that.

"Remy," he said, "I'm going to call you Remy. You remind me of that name."

He looked at his subject and nodded his head.

"Yep... I like the sound of that...

...Remy Raccoon!"
