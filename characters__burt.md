Burt - The Frog Of Inconsistent Size
=======================================

An alien Robii, the most consistency thing about Burt is his inconsistency.

Burt isn't even made of matter, he is made of forces simulating matter.

Burt is even of inconsistent size.

Burt is somehow of inconsistent location too. No one really sees him teleport anywhere. He just shrinks to being unobservable, and shows up growing elsewhere. He follows characters around and shows up inthe strangest places.

The number of instances of Burt's physical can vary. There can be 1 occurance of Burt in the present, or multiple, all at different locations. Burt often follows several characters *at the same time*, even when they are far away from each other. He's constantly showing up in strange places.

Burt only seems to deeply communicate with Remy.  They go way back!

Burt is fun and carefree.  Behaviorally, he's more like a cat than a dog.

He is actually from a hyperadvanced race, was only passing through. Burt's technology is so advanced it is indistinguishible from magic, Wilbert is the only character who even begins to comprehend it.

Even for his own race, Burt represents a new development. He is in some ways greater than his predecessors, even though he was young and careless.

Burt is in some ways, by the definitions of his own race, a child.

His accident was the result of his carelessness, his youth and relative inexperience.

Burt is potentially formlessbut does exhibit a form in our world. His appearance is a kind of projection, though it imprints and stays fairly consistent after the damage he incurs in his mistake. He based his frog appearance on Earth's life forms, his shape at the time of landing, and random senseless gibberish he was thinking. (The handlers later imitate his appearance.)

The crash against Earth doesn't hurt Burt at all.  Only the crash against spacetime caused the damage.

For the remainder of the story, Burt essentially has "brain damage". He behaves very strangely and non-seriously. He is somewhat insane, and senseless.

Burt truely loves his friends, even if his expressions are unclear and his behavior is very strange.  This love, together with their own love shown towards him, ultimately saves them all from the handlers.

Burt's handlers initially want to correct his mistaken arrival, by annilating the universe in which he has landed. They are eventually convinced to leave the universe alone and let him stay. They also reveal that after enough time (millenia) they expect him to fully heal. Burt is allowed to remain with his friends and recover there, on Earth.



Burt like to eat treats! These can be anything. Jake often just throws him trash.
