All About Bill

 

 

Bill's brain:

 


Bill is powered by a variable output high yield cold fusion antimatter engine.  It has an estimated cell life of 100,000 years even without external recharge/refuel. Bill could be around for quite a while, and he used to joke about how he he could be "miserable for a while yet"  ;)

    The usage and management of this power core is controlled by the central processing unit which functions as a hybrid quantum spintronics/hypersphere embedded system driven by unified field mathematics paradox theory.  This hardware and its associated operating system software are built to function in both neural network and straight ahead processing modes simultaneously. In neural network mode bill's brain is somewhat indistinguishable from the human brain, which was used as the starting place in its design.  In straight ahead processing modes the CPU is able to function as more conventional computers do using multithreaded parallel processing techniques. This in effect makes him the world's fastest calculator.  Also, since this entire system is embedded in an extra dimensional hyper sphere there are no theoretical or practical limitations to the amount of memory the system will hold.  Accessing memory and thinking clearly are essentially bill's greatest limitations as the system is so complicated that pieces of memory and the occasional process can be lost track of. In this manner bills memory is similar to that of a human's.

Bill uses his built in computer in a manner similar to how a human would use an immersive vr computer
he doesn't automatically know to fully use his brains computer either. Bill didn't bother to learn that until he was much older 



Bill has a highly advanced subsystem he doesn't consciously control, and has only ever developed partial access to from his self-cpu hacking.  It this way it's similar to how human's brains control and interact with their bodies, but human's don't really have very good control.

Bills software is self writing.  In this way it is heavily adaptive and consistently growing. It is also able to function as a reparation mechanism for keeping bill in good health, both in terms of his software and hardware.

 

Bill's mechanics:

 

 

Bill's body functions without friction under ideal circumstances.  His joints motors and additional systems work by complex manipulation of unified field theory. In this sense they are very similar to standard repulsor lifts.  (Think of trains that hover above the track, most of bill functions internally in a similar manner.)

 

Power distribution is accomplished by a large distributor in bills chest.  This is what can be seen through the transparent area of bills logo.

 

Bill has an extensive sensor array throughout his entire body.  Although these are able to function in a very sensitive manner, they do not always. The pain threshold is set relatively high in most areas of his body by default. 
Pain is more of a startling reaction for bill and buck, they 'heal' ultra easily, since they are never really very damaged, and mostly just stunned by the sudden  sensory input.  They are impervious to things like chronic pain, because they acclimate very quickly even to extremes.  They might not "like" it very much though, but it would be mildly annoying, not painful.  Also, Buck would overreact psychologically, partially for attention.




 

 

 

 

Random facts about Bill:

 

 

Is built out of a super steel alloy 

 

 

Has a built in cold fusion reactor with an estimated fuel cell light of >100,000 years, even at moderate to high output.

He has short term burst tanks

 


They both wear beanies. these served two functions to provide airflow for their cooling system and also has an emergency flying device although flying is incredibly difficult for these robots, and they don't even know about it until way later.

 

They lived on a farm on Vancouver island where there was a playground with a set of swings where they used to play 

 

The two robots met with Timmy whom they now live with in a small town named Utop.
