Project Planning and Development For Bill And Buck
------------------------------------------------------

This git repo contains planning for the Bill And Buck project and its related ficticious universe.  big picture overviews, project goals, styleguides, works in progress, ideas, etc.  This repo can include any parts of the planning for Bill And Buck that have been made publicly available but are not yet published on the main site.

Essentially this repo is a place where those interested in the development of Bill and Buck, can read some of the pre-production work.  It really helps for getting comments and feedback.

If Bill And Buck has any sort of "canon", it is not here, but rather is the web site, billandbuck.com.  For the moment, even that is in a state of flux.  Eventually canon will stablize, but probably not for a very long time (years).

Nothing on in this repo is necessarily canon.  Things that are probably potentially or for the the moment canon, will be marked as such.




Big Picture Plans And Philosophies For The Project
================================================


Goal (currently)
====================

The initial and current goal is to build up the story in a format of prose and illustrations, like a novel or series of novels. This story is also supplemented by supporting materials, such as character's personal logs, fact sheets. The main content (core story) would be targeted at an audience older children, and also hopefully be entertaining and likeable for older audiences as well.  The targeting is to be something like the way initial Pixar films, Star Wars films, or Harry Potter books were targeted.

There is certainly enough depth in the core story to make it interesting to adults. It deals with some *very* deep philosophical questions.

Bill And Buck is not targeted at very young children. However, certain content will be made to target. Such or short picture books for younger children, which would be mostly illustrations with some text.

Ultimately, if it ever became possible, Bill And Buck would be presented in a variety of media.  In fact much of it was originally planned as a series of short animated films and comics or graphic novels.

However, since production on those is beyond my (Joe Crawford's) current abilities, and budget, I've instead decided to do it as a written story with some illustrations.  Ideally, in the long run such material would eventually be Creative Commons licensed.

The goal of the project is not to make money, it's basically just a hobby. I don't even care if it's ever popular. I'll be satisfied as long as I like it and believe it's a fun or interesting story.






Presentation of Narrative
==============================

Art Syle
-----------------






Naration
-----------

Joe Crawford serves as the narrator. In audio formats, voice acting for characters may be Joe or someone else. Female characters, in particular, will either be voiced by another person or a recording of Joe's voice will be heavily modified on computers to sound female (if that's ever doable).


Perspecitve
------------

The vast majority of the narrative is presented by an in universe character, Quoia.  She is the final creation of the story's primary villian, Wilbert. Quoia is ultimately good, honest and of incredible integrity. (She learned from Bill when Bill was at his best.)

After the events of the main story, Quoia creates and maintains an archive so that people can know what happened in the "Times of Wilbert". She does this in part so that her world can never forget, and instead can learn from those past mistakes and live in Utopia. The utopia she lives in is the city of Utope, and its greatness is the result of applying those lessons learned. (Utope, her city of residence, was named as such long before it ever became a real utopia. In fact, the name is what really inspired Quoia to turn in into a utopia.)



Who Is Quoia?
-------------------

Quoia is a journalist and librarian. She continues to live long after the events of the main story, and she runs the library which contains the Bill and Buck archive (which she initially founded). Quoia is also a contributor to her local city's newspaper, The Uptope Tribune.

Quoia is the direct creation of Wilbert.


How Does Quoia Know So Much About Historical Events?
-----------------------------------------------

Historical knowledge comes to Quoia is several ways.

First, as intended by Wilbert, who constructed Quoia, she has all the memories of Wilbert buried deep inside of her memory. When Wilbert constructed Quoia, he copied all of the information from his brain into a section she'd be able to itermittently access later, in a read-only manner.  Quoia does not always have immediate access, and hasn't gone through it all, since it is overwhelming to her. She is in fact fairly terrified of the memories. Bravely she occasionally overcomes her fears and looks at Wilbert's memories anyway. She does this to better understand the past.

There is another *very* powerful way for Quoia to access information. Sometimes she has access to the past via the memories of another character Burt, who through the entire story, had a relatively omnipotent viewpoint, and need not look through any "lens". Unfortunately, Burt does not talk.  The the only being who seems to effectively communicate with Burt is a mute animal character, Remy the Raccoon. Remy seems at least mildly interested in helping Quoia, and encourages Burt to cough up the information. It is highly incomplete at first, but it accumulates over time and eventually Quoia has a pretty complete understanding of all the most important events.

Finally, Quoia also has direct access to the story's main characters, many of whom are still alive far into the future, and are her friends. Thus she can interview them directly, and either directly publish the interviews or use them to author a depiction of what occured, and optionally create or commision an "artist's interpretation". Quoia herself is  a major art enthusiast.



Where Is Utope? Where are the library archives?
-------------------------

In the Bill And Buck universe, much of the world is similar to but not exactly the same as our universe's planet Earth.

Utope is near Okanagon Lake, British Columbia, Canada.  It is fairly near Osoyos, just a little further north. and the library, which contains the archives is near the center of town.

There is no city of Penticton located near Utope in the Bill and Buck Universe For reasons explained elsewhere.  In fact, parts of where Penticton would be are eventually considered to be suburbs of Utope. Also, in Bill and Buck's universe, Okanagon Lake is significantly larger than it is in our universe.


When is Quoia reporting from?
----------------------------------

Mainly the 2100's, e.g. much around the year 2140 in the Utope calendar.

Quoia's life begins close to the end of the main storyline, and she takes part in those events somewhat.

Because of the time dialation of her town during the early Years of Wilbert, the Utope date system now differs from the rest of Earth's by around 100 years. Her year 2140 is closer to year 2040 standard earth time.


How far into the future is Quoia's Perspective?
--------------------------------------------------------

The farthest mentioned so far is sometime in the 23rd century, where Quoia is still alive and well, living in a near perfect Utopia, and where she is considered "Mother of Roboticcai".





What Are Roboticcai
----------------------
The race of living robots decended from Wilbert's creations, are called the Roboticcai.

Roboccai is sometimes said for short, and understood to mean the same thing.

However...

"Robai" or "Robii" as it is more commonly spelt, are even shorter words, and are often used to refer to living robots in general. (Not *only* those Roboticcai created by Wilbert and their descendents.) Colloquially in speech, people tend to say Robii. Robbai(prounced like "row" and "bye" blended into one word. )   

Thus, Burt is a Robai but he is not a Roboticcai or a Roboccai.  All Roboticcai are Robii. Not all Robii are Roboticcai.

All three words are generally both singular and plural. Some people say "Robiis" with an S sound at the end, but it's not necessary. S sounds used with the other terms are even less common.

Bill, the very first Roboticcai, (created by Wilbert) popularized the terms initially. (Some others humans, such as Timmy, had already used the term "Robai" though.) Quoia's mentor was Bill, and Quoia adopted most of his terminology and used the terms in her publications.  Humans and other Robii now do the same.

Quoia was the first genuine mother in the Roboticcai race, the first of the Roboticcai to directly have children of her own, or even to be able to.

Some other Roboticcai have children created in a manner similar to how Wilbert created Bill, but not like Quoia. Quoia's tech has never been replicated outside of her direct decendents. Wilbert's capabilities had increased dramaticly by the time he created Quoia, and thus she is technologically leagues ahead of the earlier Roboticcai, as are her children.

Remy's categorization is extremely unclear.  She seems much more like an animal than a Robii. Virtually no one considers her a Robii.
