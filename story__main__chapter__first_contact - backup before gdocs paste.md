Chapter 6 - First Contact
======================
<br>



Wilbert wasn’t precisely sure what was happening in his barn, but he was pretty sure he wasn’t alone.  Now, that he’d turned, it seemed even more likely there was someone else there with him. Someone  seemed to be rummaging around through all Wilbert’s things, because the all the shelves tables, boxes, machines, and piles of of junk, were clearly being knocked around.

There were little scratching sounds coming from behind the shelves, banging sounds from the crates, rattling of a hundred little things behind mulled about.  The really giveaway though, was the  sound of pattering feet, or at least something though sounded like feet.

Someone was clearly moving around back there, and that someone was definitely not a human being. The movement didn’t seem like a human’s movement would have been.  The motions  came in little bursts.  They were fast, then slow, then fast again, and back and forth, all over the place.  A shelf would shake over to left, and then moments later, another shelf would shake over to the right.

Wilbert could also hear what sounded like footsteps, and those footsteps sounded nothing those of a man’s.  The pattering of the feet was rapid, much to fast to be human footsteps.

The footsteps sounded more like an animals, but not like any animal Wilbert had every encountered.  Wilbert also knew there wasn’t much of interest to animals back there.  The piles of junk were mostly machines, tools, and electronics. As a result, it seemed safe to conclude that it probably wasn’t an animal going through his things. Wilbert remained quite certain that whoever was back there was not a local from his farm.

Whoever was back there must have been small too, Wilbert thought, small enough to stay hidden from view.

All of the shuffling around was happening under the loft at the north end of Wilbert’s barn, and there was so much junk back that even if another child would be hard to see walking around back there.  There were just too many things in the way.  All the shelves boxes and other things made it very hard to so much of what was going on back there.

A tiny hidden visitor didn’t seem so terrible to Wilbert. It was a little comforting actually.  If it had been a giant monster back there, Wilbert would have been a lot more worried. Wilbert realized that he was a lot less afraid that he probably should have been, even of such a small visitor. For some reason, Wilbert didn’t feel threatened.  He wasn’t sure why he had a good feeling about the situation, but it certainly helped that the visitor was probably very small.

In fact, it was quite possible that Wilbert was the scary one.  Any visitor would have been out of place in a dark and unknown location. To any such visitor, Wilbert would seem to be the stranger.

So, Wilbert decided to be slow and careful.  If he didn’t threaten the visitor, then hopefully the visitor wouldn’t threaten him.

Very slowly, Wilbert proceeded towards the north side of the barn. He attempted to follow the sounds, and began walking between the shelves. It was hard to follow the sounds because they were so scattered, but finally, they seemed to settle into an emptier area, and stopped moving around so much.

As Wilbert closed in, he heard the most unexpected sounds.

Squeak…  squeak…     Jingle,   jungle….    Ding, ding…

Wilbert pause for a moment, and actually chuckled slightly.  The sounds were very recognizable, he heard them pretty often. These were the sounds of his cat’s toys.

Wilbert’s cat wasn’t around though. At least, Wilbert didn’t think so, not right there, and not right now.  He was also pretty sure that any cat would have been scared away by all the shaking, banging, and knocking around.

Someone else must have been playing with the cat's things.

Wilbert walked over and the place he ended up was his cat’s little corner of the barn.  As Wilbert closed in, he was very careful with his flashlight.   There was a bundle of old blankets on a small table where the cat often stepped, and where Wilbert now slowly turned his gaze.  Without pointed the flashlight directly, Wilbert got enough light in the area, that when he peered towards the cat’s bed, Wilbert finally saw.

It his visitor, in full view, finally staying in one place long enough to look at, and this was, by far, the strangest sight Wilbert had ever seen.

Wilbert’s visitor was very small.  About the same size as the cat really actually, which was probably why it was now sitting in the cat’s bed.  However, Wilbert’s visitor looked nothing like a cat.

Instead, the visitor simply looked like water.  Not a pool of water though, but more like a bowl of water without the bowl. It rippled and waved, and its edges showed a vaporish haze.

Unlike a bowl of water, it didn’t stay in place, but it didn’t spill out either.  Instead, it just seemed to slowly adjust, and in moved itself around in a way that seemed to slowly point towards Wilbert.  As he looked at his visitor, Wilbert got the distinct impression that his visitor looked back at him.

Although this watery visitor was round, it wasn’t a sphere, and it was not featureless either.  At it base, many smaller little rounded blobs seemed to sit on the floor. Perhaps, these were it’s feet.

Then, the visitor started to move, just far enough to come upon a little squeaker toy, a small rubber ducky from Wilbert’s infancy.

Squeak, squeak…

With a subtle change of shape, the visitors feet were now holding the toy, and squeezing it gently.

The visitor release the toy, then backed away slightly, but before it retracted to far, it reach forward, and pushed the toy.  With a little flick, the rubber ducky was rolled in Wilbert’s.
Direction.

Kneeling down beside the visitor, slowly Wilbert picked up the rubber ducky.

Squeak, squeak…  Wilbert squeaked the ducky just as his visitor had, before putting the ducky back at the visitors side.

In response, the visitor did something similar.

Ding, ding…     the watery blob shook another one of the cat’s toys. This time it was a tiny little bell.  Just as before, it pushed the bell towards Wilbert afterward.

So again, Wilbert picked up what he’d been given.

Ding, ding…    Wilbert shook the little bell, and Wilbert started to realize what was going on.  This was a conversation.

Wilbert wasn’t normally very talkative.  He’d not generally had pleasant experiences with others, and on the rare occasions that Wilbert spoke out, it was often in anger. Communication wasn’t something Wilbert was very good at in general.  He seemed poorly suited to be humanities first contact with an alien race, but even then, this conversation seemed simple enough. Perhaps a simple introduction was all that was needed, so Wilbert spoke to his guest.

“I am Wilbert”, he said, mentally noting that these were humanity’s first words to the wider inhabitants  of the universe.

After speaking them, Wilbert waited for a response.

Silence…

Wilbert’s visitor, perhaps now better described as Wilbert’s guest, said nothing in return.  Maybe, Wilbert though, “Maybe this visitor doesn’t speak.”

Instead of saying anything, the visitor cautiously moved around and slowly appeared to look over all the little trinkets in the cat’s corner. Finally it came upon another plaything, a stuffed animal, which was orange and purple.  It was shaped like a cat itself, and was about the same size as a real cat, which also meant it was around the same size as the visitor.

The visitor slowly lifted the cat, and tumbled it around, appearing to examine it from all sides. Then, the visitor put it back down, and stepped back a little.

Slowly the visitor started to change.  It’s similarity to water became less was less, and what was clear and flowing, very gradually became colorful and solid. Soon enough, Wilbert was no longer looking at a watery blob. Instead, he was looking at a ball, one that was fluffy, orange and purple, just like the stuffed cat.

The ball shook a little, and then rocked back and forth gently. As it rocked, it gradually did so farther and farther, until it was rolling from side to side. Within a minute or so, there was a fluffy little ball rolling around Wilbert barn. This little rolling creature was probably the cutest thing Wilbert had ever seen.

Rolling around, it seemed to explore it surroundings, but it stayed back from Wilbert, not getting too close.  Since it was in the corner of the barn, and Wilbert was in it’s way, it didn’t have a lot of room to move around. It didn’t seem to mind though,  it didn’t roll past Wilbert.

Instead, it just rolled right through the west wall.
