Intermission <br> Burt's Nightmare
======================
<br>


Burt was fast asleep, but even asleep, a part of him could feel what was going on. His interpretation of events gradually deteriorated. Soon he dreamed of the worst.

It was a nightmare. Visualized by Burt was Remy's home, shattered and imploding. That wasn't the end of the disaster though.

The chaos escaped into Wilbert's Workshop. It blasted through the barn. The fields of the farm crumbled into the ground beneath. The nearby mountains broke apart and fell into the Earth.

Soon the Earth itself cracked. The sun's fire evaporated. The stars went dark. The galaxies dissolved... and the very fabric of space and time unraveled.

Burt's worries for Remy were nightmare fuel, and Burt's dreaming mind simply imagined the worst possible scenario.

The end of this entire universe, entirely Burt's fault, brought about by his sheer carelessness in exploring Wilbert's reality.

Burt's handlers, the closest thing he had to parental guardians, would not be pleased. They would condemn his interaction with creation, and remind him of the warnings they'd given regarding interference and its consequences.

None of it mattered though because Burt's nightmares were not an accurate depiction of reality.

Even though actual events came dangerously close to Burt's nightmares, and even though there could have been a chain reaction causing the end of the universe...

...there was not.


The damage to Burt was contained. He was injured, asleep, unconscious, and dreaming of his darkest worries, but the dangers stayed entirely within him and his imagination.

For the moment, Burt posed no real threat to the reality around him. For the moment, Wilbert's universe was safe enough.

The future showed promise in fact. Burt's recovery was well on track, and BBR had even been able to avoid destruction. Her presence in Remy's space being merely a projection, she now hid deep within Burt's core.

Although BBR was now cut off from contact with Wilbert and Remy, she predicted her plan would succeed. While Burt slept into sweeter dreams, BBR simply laid in wait. She was satisfied with her actions. She assumed that Wilbert was clever enough to figure out the blanket and to deliver exactly what he had promised...

...and she was right.
