Quoia


Wilbert's act of remption, Wilbert dies right  at the moment of her birth (her boot up).
She is his most impressive feat, the greatest level of tech.
Eseentially "magic" levels of tech, like the robotticai brains
Bill only comprehends the tech near his final enlightenment,
and explains to her that he can't/won't just tell her everything
he want her to learn, discover, and figure it out herself directs her


Idolizes Bill as a father

tech-flesh around living-energy

Wilbert copies his memories to her before she boots up
She remembers Wilbert's memories
but they feel like videos/recording of another persons life, she doesn't feel like she actually lived them.
She also struggles with them. The distub and frighten her, so she doesn't face them, thus her conscious memory isn't all there, and her memory gradually expands, like she has amnesia or repressed trauma memories.



May actually *be* the spirit of Wilbert, she doesn't know
and it's not entirely certain, only enlighten Bill ever knows
and he purposefully avoid telling her
she knows it's possible but doesn't want it to be true


Quoia wears clothes.  They are techy, and may sometimes be confused as being part of her, but they aren't, though she does have interactive control of them.  Clothes for her make sense because she is relatively anatomically correct. If she was without clothes, she would look strange and inappropriate to most humans.  The clothing is relatively tight fitting and flexible, pretty/feminine, but not "skimpy" and not particularly sexualized. (No obvious cleavage or anything, looking "prim and proper" by some metrics.)  She is also small "adult" sized, significantly taller than the other robots.  Unlike the earlier ones, she tends to wear a greater variety of clothes
(Bill and Buck only wear clothes during costume, dress up  disguise  etc,  not everyday normally)

Her clothing is actually the more technically obvious part about her, since her body is largely a shell for the energy plasma and robotticcai style brain contained inside.

Many parts of her are variably transparent/translucent, revealing the energy inside of her.
