Bill And Buck - Outline Of Main Storyline
=============================================

```

Burts race exists outside of our own spacetime,
(understand spirituality, but decide upon a ruleset for their own affairs which is that they won't go too deep into spirituality or religion because of the extraordinary dangers presented by these things.
Note: Arkane show ended up doing something similar conceptually, but in a very different way.  Here's it's more of a philosophy.
They don't "get into the weeds" with the inhabitants of other universes unless their own race or something similar interferes.
Not totally prime directive, but a little like that, with the exception that they will destroy universes where they've violated it, (purposefully switching the inhabitant experiencers over to a universe that represents a timeline where such interference didn't occur.  which is fundamentally the reason why Wilbert's universe is so endangered, because of the interference

Burt was always a next-generation rebel, and didn't subscribe to the no interference policy 100%, though he followed it to some degree.
He also disagreed with the no spirituality/religion rules, though he had not yet gotten into that further.

So Burt did in fact mess with the universe a lot, and his "parents" let him.




The Age Of Burt (begins)
                  (meaning as of this point the fate of the universe is tied to Burt)
                  (more immediately, Wilberts Life, the events of the farm, Utope, and Earth become dominated by)

    Burt Makes A Mistake    The Arrival Of Burt
    
    Wilbert and His Spaceship    Property Of Wilbert   Burt investigation in field
    
    Gotcha    Wilbert brings Burt home to the barn
    
    A Prelude To The Storm    Wilbert trying to get into his spaceship

    In Spite Of Fear    Wilbert sees and hears things in the dark

    First Contact    Wilbert discovers Remy and meets her
    
    Wilbert follows Remy into the spaceship
    
    Wilbert learns all about Remy, Beebeearr, and Burt, makes deal
    

    Recognizing Remy  Wilbert names Remy and concedes that he will keep her company
                           (he can't get rid of her anyway, lol)
    
    Shattering Sparkles
        Remy's home, in Bill's inner environment, looses stability and begins to shatter.

        Escape
            Wilbert is injured. Remy helps Bill out. Together they escape, *with* Remy's bedding/blankets.


    Making Sense Of It All

        Back in the workshop, Wilbert tries to figure out what he's supposed to do

        Wilbert realizes that the blankets have the ability to generate at least some sparkles itself,
            though these sparkles destabilize quickly.  Remy can manipulate these as well.

        Wilbert finds the rings in the blanket.  Only one of the rings actually works though.
        The other is a solid blank barrier.  Even Remy refuses to go into it.

        Wilbert discovers that the blanket is highly malleable, and stretches effectively, forever.
        The ring does the same thing, though it's a bit rough, because at first, it sucks air in like crazy.
        Fortunately, the rushing air has no effect on the stretching of the ring.
        It seems to need manual adjustment.

        The edges and their padding at the corners have friction, though the center of each edge has no friction,
        but the area around the ring, and the ring itself is totally frictionless.

        Finally (the next day?) the air pressure has stabilized. How big is that space?
        Does the word big even apply?  How did it acclimate to the atmosphere? (real answer is because that's what it's designed to do)



    A Sip Of Water
        Wilbert tries to use a garden hose to fill the ring with water, but it doesn't help.

        Even many farm hoses really doesn't so much to help.

        So Wilbert tries a river, and the ring just chugs the water out of the river.
        Wilbert decides he needs a lake, and fortunately, there's a lake not far from his farm.

        Wilbert gets a big knapsack and gets a old inflatable raft,  and goes to the lake

        Wilbert tosses the blanket, tied to a rock, into the lake, and it starts flooding trough the ring,
        but the overall efffect is minor because the lake as a whole is so huge.

        Wilbert stretches the blanket, ring opening face down, over the lake.
        He starts throwing big rocks into the lake and they start pushing the top of the blanket down, which of course starts swallowing all the water underneath them and starts
            
        

    Thirst Quenching    Wilbert starts to provided Beebeearr with Water...  uses portal in lake



    Wilbert Discovers A Part Of "Burt's Warehouse"
        Because 

        Burt is a pakrat, just like Wilbert's Aunt  Wow, they do have something in common!

        This is actually a part of the environment for Remy.
        Remy is able to manipulate the environment enough to walk around in it.
        Most of the warehouse is not set up for Remy though, so they only have access to little bits.

        Wilbert starts playing with things he's learned.





    Back In The Dark
        Wilbert returns to BBR, who is now godlike in power, but is careful regarding how he applies that power to Wilbert.

        Does agree to provide Wilbert with a translator, and access to info
        (and though not revealed yet, the "training materials" in the "library")


    Wilbert discovers the    "Library of Wilbert"
            (collection, partially reordered by BBR so that Wilbert can learn)

        Wilbert starts building and experimenting with the tech at his disposal, which is just stupid advanced
            receives significant assistance from BBR, to whom all of the most advanced tech is child's play.

        Wilbert find the remenants of a technology school, with "examples" to learn from. "learning playground"

        Wilbert becomes more and more frustrated.




    Wilbert's Renassance      "Make me understand,  I'm a scientist and an engineer"
        Wilbert's gradual transformation begins.
        Wilbert's body is made to stay young.

        This also drives Wilbert further towards instability/insanity
        As do the extended learning experiences ("the jaunt")

        Wilbert's attitude remains, and he continues making careless mistakes
        missing a lot of details.
        His arrogance, and not reading docs or asking for help
        contribute to the sloppiness and inconsistency of his work.

        

    The Time Of Wilbert (begins)
            (this is the part of the story where Wilbert *really* starts to get on a roll)

        Fabbing Fabs
            like wishing for infinite wishes

        The importance of friends

            Wilbert Decides that he wants to build friends



        The Making Of The Body Of A New Friend
            Wilbert builds a body for Purplinka Puffin, a friend for Remy



        The Planning of new friends
            Wilbert learns about creating automotons and "life"

            Wilbert learns of the handlers

                Wilbert learns just a tiny bit about the handlers spirituality
                and the hard limitations they place on themselves and the topic in general

                The ethics are slightly challenging to BBR,
                but BBR decides that it's not too far a step to help
                Basically teaches "just enough"
                and of course doesn't do anything the handlers wouldn't do anyway.


            Wilbert can't 

            Wilbert learns about neural networks etc but doesn't understand them enough.

            Wilbert realizes the one thing he really can't make or even sufficiently modify enough is a brain

            Wilbert learns from BBR

            Bill figures out how to create a "brain" handler space-magic-tech style

                Energy-field-intellect
                a hyperdimensional, non-enclidience, highly-connected, entangled, and most importantly chaotic network
            
                Makes a brain for purplinka puffin using fairly "off the shelf" template for the energy-field-intellect

        
        The Making Of The Brain Of A New Friend
            Wilbert builds a brain for Purplinka Puffin, a friend for Remy.
            Uses a pretty standardize template.

            Ends up working great for Purplinka.  Purplinka has a pet like personality



        The Preparation Of Bill
            Wilbert realizes that in order to create a proper friend,
            he'll need real intelligence

            Uses his own brain as a blueprint, and carries over many concepts
                and personality traits from himself.
            Wilbert is careful not to make the raw intelligence too high
                Wilbert *does not* want the new friend to be smarter than himself

            Bill's brain is ready


        The Creation of Of Bill
            Wilbert creates Bill a combination of fabs and available parts in the warehouse
                Wilbert is still not smart enough to design it all from scratch

            Wilbert creates three parts, the brain, the head and the body

            Wilbert combines the Brain and the body
                Bill Is basically just a head at this point, although a body is largely prepared too


        Meet Bill
                (Wilbert starts up Bill, specifically Bill's brain in Bill's head)
            Bill's first awakening as Bill
            
            Eventually Bill will have a functional enough body


        Bill In Storage
            Bill gets put in storage, as a disembodied head, and he doesn't like it

        Build Bill Better
            Wilbert Improves Upon Bill, a little bit at a time

        Back to Storage
            Bill goes back into storage where he wonders "what to do with spare time?"
            Bill reads and watches videos.
            Wow, Wilbert is a real brat


        The Problem With Free Will
            Bill decides not to play ball, both metaphorically and figuratively

            "Ha, now I understand what they mean they say someone won't 'play ball' lol."
            Wilbert began to learn first hand what people meant they complained someone won't 'play ball'"


        Bill in Storage
            Bill is frequently locked in the closet in this stage, but still allowed out quite often


        Locked In A Closet
            Bill is now almost always locked in the closet in this stage

            (Burt's attention draws more focus from larger more nefarious enemies)

            Intergallactic Evil Empire

            Wilbert and the Gang put their differences aside for the greater good.
                (Wilbert is eventually sort of a "good guy" after this point,
                  though he still has real attitude problems, and is a pain
                  but is mostly more of an ally than an enemy)

            Wilbert ultimately fights off the enemy,
                with the aid of his friends and the Intergallactic Federation

        
        Bill And Buck Save The Universe (begins)
            
            Bill's premonitions begin
                Forsees the great adjustment but can't fully comprehend what's going on

                Universal Trial
                    Universal Trial isn't won but results in enough delay for Bill's eventual spiritual development
                    (the trial triggers Bill's commitment as well, in addition to his preminatory dreams)
                    so that he can assist in preventing the Great Adjustment.

                    The gang learns about the potential of the
                    Great Adjustment - Effectively the end of the universe and all life in it.
                       All experiencers either die or awaken in an alternate timeline.  Bill forsees this.

            This Is The Worst
                The gang realizes that the Handlers
            
            Give It Everything You've Got

            Climax
                Bill Wilbert and BBR collectively contact Wilbert and communicate
                with his subconcious in a hypermetaphorical environment

                As everything is being destroyed, Burt is finally awakened just enough to oppose his "parents"

                The universe is saved

            Please Leave Us Alone
                The gang works at convincing the handlers to stay away, long term.

                So They Have Some Morals After All
                    The other entities agree that Burt's development in Earth's universe is worthwhile
                    (only because Burt sort of contacted them)
                    Burts relationships are really the reason
            
                Who Burt Really Is
                    we learn more about Burt since he managers to temporarily have enough cognition to communicate

"Something so horrible is going to happen.  It's so much.  No, horrible isn't the right word.  Final is perhaps better.  The end of everyone everywhere, the end of everywhere itself, a final corner in space time, the end of time itself.  Since nothing after this point of decision matters, the universe starts rapidly falling apart into chaos, so its a nasty messy place up until the end."
"Everyone starts half remembering other versions of themselves while also being driven mad, dying here."


"Burt is in fact a child.  The first of what some hope may be a new generation.  Though he is older than your universe, in terms of"
Burt will learn and play for a very very long time before transitioning to more advanced stages of development. He's still a caterpillar intellectually and although there is a solid plan to go on to his next stage of development, that won't happen until much farther into the future than you could imagine."
