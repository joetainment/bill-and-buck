Chapter 8 - In Darkness Are Strangers
======================
<br>



Wilbert watched as Remy Raccoon walked about his barn, and then slowly circled back to the cat's corner.

She looked over the toys and found the bell that she'd played with earlier. With her front paws, she picked up the bell, and then walked over to the plush cat. With a quick nod of her head, she poked her nose into its neck, right through it in fact! Then after a little shaking, and some motions that Wilbert couldn't quite discern, she turned back toward him. Remy emerged from the cat's corner, now wearing the plush cat's collar. Attached to it was her little bell.

With her new accessory, Remy walked towards Wilbert, then past him, in the direction of the spaceship. Before going much further though, she turned around to face him.

Tinkle, tinkle!

Remy shook her head and rang the bell.  As Wilbert watched he could tell that her actions were very intentional. His interest was peaked, but he didn't immediately get the message, so Remy stepped back then rang the bell again.

Tinkle, tinkle!

In response, Wilbert walked toward Remy, and once he was close to her, Remy turned and continued further towards the spaceship, ringing the bell as she went

Wilbert now understood. He was being directed. Remy was bringing Wilbert back to her spaceship, which was in Wilbert's mind, his spaceship.

It was slightly insulting to be led about by a raccoon, especially since Wilbert liked to be in charge. However, he was willing to follow along for now. This was all much too interesting to ignore.

Remy finally reached the spaceship, which was then the size of a small car. Wilbert caught up with Remy, and she rang the bell one more time.  Then, she jumped up sideways, right into the black panel of the spaceship. Unlike Wilbert, who hadn't been able to get through that panel, Remy passed through easily, and then she disappeared into the darkness.

Wilbert tried to follow, but as he reached into the window, his hand just crashed into it. Unlike Remy, he couldn't just pass through things.

"No, no, no," said Wilbert, hoping Remy might understand, "I can't follow you in there."

Wilbert tried to knock on the window, but doing so made no sound, so instead he knocked on the green hull of the spaceship, which made a loud metallic sound just as he would have expected.

"Remy?"  Wilbert continued to call out to his little visitor, over and over again.  He got no immediate response.

Wilbert became more and more frustrated. He continued banging on the spaceship, harder and harder, and he kept yelling at Remy, louder and louder.

After what seemed like far too long (but was actually only a couple minutes) Remy was back.  She popped her head into view, behind the window. Then she rubbed her little paws against it, almost like she was washing the window.

In response to her paws, the window twinkled brightly, with tiny flashes of white light, and little bubbling rainbows. The effects were much like those Wilbert had seen on the surface of the ship when he had shined his flashlight upon it.

By the time Remy stopped rubbing the window, it looked like someone had splashed glitter all over it.  Thousands of tiny little spots of light continued to twinkle across.

Remy then seemed to pull on the backside of the window, and surprisingly, the glittering highlights stretched back. Soon, Wilbert was looking into what seemed like a long tunnel of stars. At the far end of the tunnel was Remy, continuing to back away slowly, and disappearing into the darkness, as if it was a fog.

Wilbert reached out with his hand one more time, and now, finally, he could reach beyond where the window had been, when his hand came into contact with the side of the tunnel, he could feel the roughness of all the little sparkles. The tiny glitters of light felt something like a rocky surface, but one in which the little bits of rock were dancing.  The feel of this surface was a very strange sensation, but at least it wasn't perfectly slippery anymore.

Wilbert's mind raced with excitement.  Finally, he could really get inside of his spaceship!  With both hands, he reached into the ship, pushed against the sides of the tunnel, and pulled himself through the window's opening.  It worked, even though the feeling of the sparkling surface was pretty strange.

Once inside the tunnel, Wilbert noticed another interesting sensation.  It was subtle at first, but it soon became the rushing of wind.  It was clear and unmistakable. Outside air was pouring in from the window's entrance, into the darkness beyond.

This actually made sense to Wilbert, because he knew that an expanding space would be filled by the atmosphere of its surroundings. It was elementary really, the basics of atmospheric pressure.

Wilbert crawled further forward, but he noticed that as he got farther along, he was reaching wider parts of the tunnel. Soon he had enough room that he was able to stand right up. Looking around, he observed the tunnel's ceiling fading away into the darkness, it's walls widening. The path before him, the floor, was disconnecting from the walls.  Still, in the distance, he could see that the floor did continue.

Marching on, Wilbert was well aware that there was far too much space in the tunnel.  Even if the spaceship had been a little larger, this tunnel was much too huge to fit inside the spaceship. Wilbert shook his head again in disbelief, but proceeded forward anyway.

Occasionally, he looked back, and he noticed the entrance behind him was starting to be harder and harder to see. It was becoming enveloped in darkness, as if a fog was becoming thicker the farther into the darkness he went. This was definitely troubling, but it wasn't enough to dissuade Wilbert. Instead, he pressed on, moving further and further along the sparkling path while the opening behind him faded into a deep black haze. 

As Wilbert continued along the narrow path it gently began to curve. Before long, Wilbert found himself walking in circles.

Around and around he went, but the strangest part about it was that he never crossed his prior path of sparkles, nor did he even see any indication of it. In all the darkness, the only part of the path he could ever see was the part he was on in the moment. 

He stayed level as he walked, so he was fairly sure he was not walking above or below any other part of his path. It seemed impossible that this path could avoid looping back on itself, but somehow it didn't.

After he'd walked around in a circle six or seven times, the path finally became straight again. After continuing just a little further down, Wilbert reached what seemed like the end of the road.

The sparkling path went no further, and what Wilbert saw ahead was only an infinite void. After coming so far, he was blocked again. Wilbert couldn't let this be the end of his journey.

Without knowing what else to do, Wilbert decided to call out,  "Remy!  ...Remy, where are you?"

Within a few moments Remy reappeared. She was upside down, but in a slow tumble, descending from above and in front of Wilbert. It was as if Remy were rolling down a flight of stairs, but of course, there were no stairs. There was only the end of the sparkly path. As she tumbled down to Wilbert's level, Remy uncurled her paws, and set herself upright on the sparkly floor.

After stabilizing her balance, Remy walked ahead of Wilbert. Then she rubbed her little paws on the floor. Its sparkling increased and the path extended just a little farther. In the darkness, along that last bit of the path, was revealed a small pile of strange but soft looking objects.

Wilbert noticed the vague similarity to his cat's bed, before he observed Remy walk on top of the soft pile, kneel down, and settle in. At this point she seemed very relaxed.

Tired from all the walking, Wilbert decided that Remy had the right idea.  It would be nice to take a bit of a break and give his feet some rest. Since there seemed to be quite a bit of room on the bed, he sat down as well. For several minutes, both of them simply relaxed in that spot, while Wilbert wondered about the nature of the darkness surrounding them.

...

Eventually Remy moved her head towards Wilbert and nuzzled at his side, drawing his attention. Then she raised her paw, and pointed off at an angle, high above and in front of them. Wilbertâ€™s eyes followed to where she was pointing, up above.

Looking up, a faint light was seen glowing. It was dim at first, and Wilbert couldn't be sure whether it was just small or very far away.

The two of them kept watching. Gradually, more little sparkles gathered together until the light seemed much closer and brighter.

Finally a sound came upon them, a sound that seemed the size of the entire universe, coming from every direction at once. Though it was like nothing Wilbert had ever heard before, he was able to vaguely interpret it as a single word.

It was quite an incredible sound, and it functioned as a sort of announcement, an introduction. As if it were saying...


...behold...
