Chapter 3 - Gotcha
======================
<br>

The day after...

It was morning, and the sun was shining bright as it rose from behind the mountains. Wilbert was up and wide awake, excited to get back to his spaceship. He had barelly slept all night, his mind racing, full of possibilities.

More than any other, it was one single idea that had Wilbert so excited.

"The wagon", he'd though, "If I go get my wagon, then I can use it to carry away my spaceship."


Wilbert had a quick bite to eat, packed some food for later, and did some other simple preparations to leave. Then he grabbed his bag, left his house, and walked towards his old barn nearby.

As he walked he looked around at many of the farm's other fixtures. All sorts of buildings, machines and vehicles cluttered the landscape, as if frozen in time.  Tractors and trucks, barns and silos, all just sitting there empty. Few of these things had been used for quite some time.

The entire farm had been left to Wilbert's parents, but they were never farmers. They had no interest in farming. They didn't even bother to find someone else to do the farming. The whole farm just sat there, wasting away.

As Wilbert marched along he passed his playground, and then finally looked ahead to the one building that was still very much in use. It was an old barn, and it was a place that was deeply special to Wilbert. It was Wilbert's workshop, nd it had been so ever since his aunt had left it to him.

Wilbert *loved* his workshop. Of evey place on the farm, it was his favorite.

The workshop was full of Wilbert's projects, machinery, equipment, and all kinds of other junk. His aunt had been a bit of a packrat and a tinkerer, which meant she'd collected a lot of random stuff over the years. Now all of that stuff belonged to Wilbert. Over the last year, Wilbert had really made the workshop his own. Labels and stickers were strewn throughout, and most of them said, "Property of Wilbert".


Wilbert walked up to the barn door, opened it, and surveyed the inside of his workshop. He only needed to find one thing, his trusty red wagon. Fortunately, the wagon was easy to spot, and Wilbert quickly grabbed it and towed it out of the barn.

Excited, and hauling his wagon along with him, Wilbert raced away from the barn, down the dirt path into the field. Retracing his steps from the day before, he navigated about, searching for the site of the crash. Finally, he came upon it.

Unfortunately, something was horribly wrong...

There was no spaceship!

Wilbert stared at the crash site, which was now mostly just an empty pit of dirt. Then he looked around hastily. It couldn't have gone far, he thought, could it? Could the ship have just flown away?

After all, it *was* a spaceship, he thought, and spaceships *do* fly away. In fact, that's what spaceships were for: Flying through space.

Wilbert could have started to panic with that realization, but he calmed himself down and attempted to gather his thoughts.

Something very strange was going on, and Wilbert had a suspicion the spaceship hadn't just flown away. If it could have just flown away, why was it sitting in the field yesterday? If nothing was wrong with it, why did it even crash?

Could someone else have taken it?

Wilbert looked around at the dirt, scanning for footprints or tire tracks. Fortunately, he saw no others. Only his own footprints and his wagon's own wheel tracks. It seemed unlikely someone else had been here.

Then Wilbert remembered... the spaceship had rocked so easily the day before. In fact, it had seemed a little *too* easy to move. Wilbert had been able to lift the entire ship with only his bare hands. This train of thought brought Wilbert to another idea. Maybe the spaceship had simply been blown away by the wind?

On further reflection though, to Wilbert, even the wind didn't seem like a plausible explaination. Yesterday, although he'd been able to gently lift the spaceship, it had been so difficult to move it very far, or even just to get it out from the dirt. How could it have simply blown away so easily?

In any case, Wilbert soon decided that he had better start looking for his spaceship.

For the next several hours, Wilbert searched all over the fields. He went all the way to the base of the mountain, then up to the big rocks where the fields met the quary. He looked around the grassy hills, and walked down to the creek. He even explored the nearby forests a little,and checked into the ravine where he supposed, as a longshot, that the spaceship could have rolled off to.

All his searches were of no avail. He kept searching all day, but the spaceship was in none of the places he went looking.

Wilbert was starting to get very angry again, but he was still etermined to succeed. He was going to find his spaceship! As the afternoon faded, he walked back towards the site of the crash so that he could take a closer look there, perhaps to find a clue.

Suddenly, as Wilbert approached the site of the crash, he stopped, and gasped in disbelief. Just up ahead, sitting in the dirt, was Wilbert's spaceship. It was right where he'd first found it, as if it had never moved at all.

Wilbert ran back to his ship, cheering and jumping in celebration.

Once he arrived back at the ship, he paused, because he noticed that some aspect of the arrangement seemed odd. Even though Wilbert couldn't tell exactly what had changed, something did seem different, not the same as it had been the day before. It seemed at though the spaceship appeared not to fit neatly into the dirt. At least, not in quite the same way it had fit earlier.

Wilbert's mind was racing, trying to understand how and why the spaceship could have gone away, and how it could have come back again. Wilbert decided it didn't matter though, at least not at the moment.  What mattered was getting his spaceship back to the workshop before he lost it again.

Wilbert dug away much of the dirt, and then carefully placed his wagon beside the ship. He moved around to the far side of the ship and began slowly pushing it upwards. Just like the day before, Wilbert was able to raise the ship off the bed of dirt. As he pushed on the ship, it ascended as if it were on a string. Even when he took his hands away, the ship floated eerily mid-air before it slowly began to sink again.

Unlike the day before, this time Wilbert was prepared. He kept lifting slowly, and when he finally got the ship high enough, he had just enough time. He quickly moved and nudged his wagon underneath the ship, before it came down to rest upon the wagon.

It was a very odd arrangement, as Wilbert's spaceship was much larger than his wagon. Luckily, the forms fit together well enough. There was a bulge on the bottom of the ship, near the back, and it made for a study base when placed on the wagon. As Wilbert gently pulled the assembly, he realized that the entire thing was extremely off balance. Somehow, it didn't fall over. Somehow, it seemed to *want* to stay upright.

As he continued to pull the wagon, his spaceship followed very naturally. Trucking carefully towards his barm, Wilbert moved slowly but steadily. Wilbert was not about to lose track of his spaceship again.

As the evening darkened, Wilbert made it back to his barn, his spaceship still in tow. Once inside, Wilbert pulled his wagon to the middle of his workshop, then gently tipped the wagon backwards. As he did so, his spaceship slowly slid off the wagon and onto the floor. It made barely a sound as it settled into place at the center of the old barn.

Wilbert was very pleased with himself as he looked upon his new prize. He even spoke a single word to his ship, almost as if it could hear him:


"Gotcha."
