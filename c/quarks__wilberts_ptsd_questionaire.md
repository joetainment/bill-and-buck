
Wilbert refused to cooperate with this questionaire, but I have used my interviews with him to approximate what I believe his answers would be if he responded honestly.




Use these numerical ratings to answer the following questions:

0   Not at all
1   A little bit
2   Moderately
3   Quite a bit
4   Extremely




In the past month, how much were you bothered by:

1. Repeated, disturbing, and unwanted memories of the
stressful experience?  4   

2. Repeated, disturbing dreams of the stressful experience? 4   

3. Suddenly feeling or acting as if the stressful experience were actually happening again (as if you were actually back there reliving it)?  1   Wilbert doesn't seem to "relive" this experience so much as just remember it and feeling fear anger.

4. Feeling very upset when something reminded you of the
stressful experience?  4    However Wilbert lashes out a lot in general, so it isn't clear that his upsets are due to being reminded.

5. Having strong physical reactions when something reminded you of the stressful experience (for example, heart pounding, trouble breathing, sweating)?  4

6. Avoiding memories, thoughts, or feelings related to the stressful experience?  2

7. Avoiding external reminders of the stressful experience (for example, people, places, conversations, activities, objects, or situations)?  2

8. Trouble remembering important parts of the stressful
experience?  3  Wilbert's memories seem clear even if he is reluctant to discuss them.

9. Having strong negative beliefs about yourself, other people, or the world (for example, having thoughts such as: I am bad, there is something seriously wrong with me, no one can be trusted, the world is completely dangerous)?  4   Wilbert is definitely very angry and blames others as his former classmates. Although he won't say it, there are strong indicators that he blames himself as well.

10. Blaming yourself or someone else for the stressful
experience or what happened after it?  4  (see above)

11. Having strong negative feelings such as fear, horror, anger, guilt, or shame?  4   Again, this seems to be the case though Wilbert won't discuss it directly.

12. Loss of interest in activities that you used to enjoy?  1

13. Feeling distant or cut off from other people?  4

14. Trouble experiencing positive feelings (for example, being unable to feel happiness or have loving feelings for people close to you)?  3

15. Irritable behavior, angry outbursts, or acting aggressively?  4
16. Taking too many risks or doing things that could cause you
harm?  4

17. Being "superalert" or watchful or on guard?  2

18. Feeling jumpy or easily startled? 0

19. Having difficulty concentrating? 0

20. Trouble falling or staying asleep? 4
