Report
-----------------------

Wilbert was initially referred to me after he was involved in a pattern of violent incidents near the end of October 1994. None of which were proven to have been initiated by Wilbert. Please see my prior reports for a summary of the situation so far.

This current report was requested by Utope RCMP, and is in follow up to the earlier reports requested by Principle Keaton of Utope elementary. Permission to interview Wilbert has again been provided by Wilbert's father, Robert Watterson, who has agreed to let me (Carl Wilson) re-evaluate his son's condition.

As noted before, Wilbert has proven to be extremely difficult to understand or diagnose using any accepetable psychiactric theory. His intelligence combined with his clear understanding of the nature of these discussions, has allowed him to purposefully manipulate the process far more than any typical child would be able to. It has proven nearly impossible to differentiate which communications from Wilbert are genuine. Explicitly, I will note that for his age, Wilbert is both the most intelligent and most manipulative student I had ever personally interviewed.

Regarding Wilbert's current psychiatric condition, further documentation and test results are attached, but the most important points are summarized below:

The clearest observation I can make is that Wilbert is currently suffering from post traumatic stress disorder. At this point, it is clearly a result of his witnessing his aunt's drowning. In addition, he is most likely dealing with extreme feelings of guilt and shame. The events of the thunderstorm, Wilbert's abduction by the other children, and Rose's tragic involvement have most likely left Wilbert with feelings of responsibility, even if he will not admit to such feelings.

All of this is complicated by the fact that, as earlier reports have mentioned, Wilbert was probably already suffering from at least one serious mental disorder. Although indications are not clear enough to make any solid diagnosis, Wilbert has shown warning signs of sociopathy, and possible borderline personality disorder. (Is is important to note that borderline personality disorder is particularly hard to diagnose in children.)

Wilbert's case is atypical because of its inconsistency. In many situations, for long periods, Wilbert will present as an ordinary child. His emotions seem normal until he suddenly becomes emotionally hyper-reactive. Usually as a result of some form of irritation. Once triggered, Wilbert shows a complete lack of impulse control, delusional thinking, and an inability to consider his relationships to those around him. At his worst, Wilbert has probably been strategically violent, while obfuscating his actions and also while being fully aware of his limited legal exposure as a minor.

For the time being, my recommendation is that Wilbert be removed from any public interaction, and if possible, be relocated to an appropriate treatment or correctional facility. It is too dangerous to have Wilbert in contact with any other children, especially given his tendency to draw bullying, and the escalating retaliations we have all observed.
