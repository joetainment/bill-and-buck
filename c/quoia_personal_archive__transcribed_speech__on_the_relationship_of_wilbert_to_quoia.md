Excerpt of the explanation given by Quoia regarding her relationship to Wilbert


<span><br>[Transcription of statement originally by Quoia]<br></span>


I have to address this situation. It's consumed us. Suddenly everyone's talking about it. For a long time I've known people have been talking about me and believing the worst. That I am the enemy.


People talk, they have talked and they will talk. I've overheard the things they say about me.


I’ve seen the looks, the sideways glances, the disdain. Some of them are saying the worst, and some of them really believe it.


I can see *why* they believe it. The whole thing is so suspicious, and all the pieces fit, especially for anyone who wants them to. Maybe they have to twist those pieces, but really, not very hard. It wouldn't take much because it might be true.



I might *be* Wilbert.



Am I *actually* Wilbert? Is Wilbert *me*? Did Wilbert *become* me?


I don't know…  and I don't think I'll ever know.


I have his memories, but I don't know that I ever lived them. I only know he copied them to my computing core before I was complete.


And yeah, I know that I was created around a specific notable time, the time of The End of Wilbert.


*Of course* I understand how suspicious that is.

<br><br><br>

To be clear, I do remember the things that Wilbert remembered.


I remember new things everyday. I don't even know what I'll remember next. I suspect it will take years for me to go through the layers, and some of it I don't even want to remember.

Even then, through it all, never, not even once, have I ever remembered *being* Wilbert. It's like watching a movie. It's like watching a movie of being somebody else.

Perhaps I simply forget being Wilbert. I don't believe it though. I don't believe I was ever Wilbert.

Am I lying to myself?

I can't know, but I also know I'd be lying to you if I said it didn't keep me up at night.

Now though, I've made a decision:

I will act as though I am not Wilbert,  I will live as though Wilbert was a totally different person.

It really doesn't make sense to worry about this. The case for me being Wilbert is entirely circumstantial. There's no solid evidence that I'm Wilbert, there never was, and there never will be. I can't even see how, even if only in theory, there could be such evidence.

It's almost like asking a question about our very souls.

There are some questions not even science can ever answer. I'll always remember this. It was one of the most valuable lessons I ever learned from Bill.


Am I the reincarnation of Wilbert?

I choose to say no, and I believe in my choice. I have to. It would be of no use anyway, believing and acting as if I had been Wilbert.

I can never be certain though. I can never give an entirely straight answer.  It's an absolute impossibility for me to ever be sure.


<br><br><br>


Please, in terms of the here and now, I need you to think about something. 

I could have said, "No I'm not Wilnert", and this whole ordeal would have been mostly over with.

However, if I really want to be different than Wilbert, I have to behave differently. I can't do or say the sorts of things he would have done or he would have said.

When I talk about Wilbert's behavior here, I'm talking about how he behaved most of his life. Wilbert's early life, Wilbert's mid life, not just Wilbert in his very old age. Not just at the end, not just when he was finally a little better, when his guilt finally caught up with him.  I'm talking about the worst version of Wilbert here, the Wilbert people seem to hate me for being.

I know that for almost his entire life, Wilbert was a terrible child. He may have gotten old but he never matured. He never grew up in the colloquial sense. Wilbert never had anything resembling an adult personality, or even a good childlike personality. If he ever grow up at all, it was only at the very end.

<br><br><br>

Now remember, I've decided that I'm not Wilbert. For that decision to work, I can't be like him. I have to be better than he was. I will be better. What all this means, is that I have to be honest, and if I'm honest, I can never say definitively that I am not some version of Wilbert.

And that's why I had to tell you.
