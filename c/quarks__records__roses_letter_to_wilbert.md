Rose To Wilbert, Shortly Before Her Death
========


Wilbert, it's not like I think you're a bad person. I think you've got a lot of anger in there from so much mistreatment, but I don't think fundamentally that there's anything bad about you. You're just so much like your mother, and she's so much like you. You both have such strong reactions to everything.

I know she can be pretty awful, but she's really not a bad person either, she has just had so much happen to her. Again, just like you.



You got to remember... I grew up with your mom, and she's my big sister. Your grandma was an amazing woman who raised us both so well. She really did raise your mom to be a good person, just like she raised me. For a long time your mom was a great girl, and she could be a good woman again, she just needs to get cleaned up and straightened out. She just needs some time to detox.

Your dad's gonna help her. The worst thing he'a ever done has been putting up with her behavior. I'm not going to him keep doing that though. I'm going to help your dad stand up for himself, and he's already agreed it has to happen.

So your mom needs a change, and she's going to get one.

You need a change too. On top of the issues with your Mom, you're dealing with the worst treatment from all those bullies at school. That's what's really triggering all of this, making you lash out. 

You both just need a break. You, because you need to get away from all those other kids. Your mom because she needs time away to get better.

At the end of the day Wilbert, being in this place is making you crazy. It's doing the same thing to you that it did to my mother.

And that's why we have to go.
