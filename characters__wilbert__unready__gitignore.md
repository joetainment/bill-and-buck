Wilbert
===========




Wilbert, to some degree, represented the worst qualities of the author (Joe). In particularly those qualities had during childhood. Wilbert's behaviour was of course an extreme exaggeration, far worse than anything any real kid has ever done.

Wilbert felt slighted, ridiculed, neglected add unloved.

The only person who really cared about Wilbert passed away some time before the The Arrival Of Burt, and events of the main story.

Wilbert was very intelligent even before finding Burt, but afterwards became hyper intelligent. This is specifically because he was intelligent enough to immediately realize how much more intelligent he could become with Beebeearr's help.

Due to his interactions with Beebeearr, is physically a perpetual child.  He never develops into an adult physically. He is permanantly a small boy, around 5 years of age.

He is very absent minded, and has a hard time staying focused. He makes mistakes and misses things he shouldm't.  He is impulsive and doesn't think out the consequences to his actions.

Sometimes, often his inventions work perfectly.  Many times though, they exhibit spectacular failures, particularly the more angry his is during their construction.

Buck, Molly, and RoKara all exhibit serious flaws. Molly especially. Bill , being created when Wilbert was more optimistic and less angry, has less mechanical/functional/computational design issues.

Extraordinarily arrogant and self centered. Only near the very end of Wilbert's life does he see the error of his ways.

Is very un-wise.

After Bill and Buck leave him, he is furious and becomes obsessed with revenge.

He eventually figures out how to be a better person. However, for a while before commiting, he oscilates between good and bad. He finally settles on seclusion and focuses of being better.

His final act is the creation of Quoia. Creating Quoia was an attempt to give back. No tricks, no lies, she was created to be really and truely good. In his eyes, she was his redemption, a robot he finally believed got it right. She was made for the betterment of the world, not to serve him. He died just before Quoia came online.

Had a strong "redemption arc", though he could never fully forgive himself.

Wilbert died not long after his part in saving the universe. It put him through such extreme stress, and ultimately sealed his fate.  He probably could have found a cure, but he didn't even try. He actually believed he deserved it, and accepted his punishment.

Looking back though, Wilbert didn't actually cause *that* much harm. He just came very very close many times. Had things gone ever so slightly worse, the results would have been catostrophic. Fortunately, Bill and the gang usually foiled his schemes. Although he terrified a lot of people, thing worked out okay in the end.
